# Choosing the Digital Humanities programme that’s right for you: an enhanced DH course registry with new data and visualizations
##A project for the ACDH-CH Hackathon 2020

###Introduction

Whether at BA, MA or PhD level, choosing the right Digital Humanities programme is not an easy task. The Digital Humanities course registry offers an ongoing list of institutions offering such programmes, besides single courses and other types of training events such as summer schools. Starting from the registry, our team decided to reuse information from other open datasets such as CrossRef and data.world in order to be able to offer not only new visualization options but also a richer insight into the orientation and characteristics of the DH programmes that are listed in the registry.

In particular, we selected a list of primarily DH-oriented journals (cf. “Research methodology” for the selection criteria). Then, we matched the journal articles with the institutions of the registry to be able to give potential students/users of the registry information about the research interests and publication stats of the DH staff of the institution; we also reconstructed the network of collaborations among the institutions on the basis of DH publications co-authored by scholars from different institutions of the registry.

We also explored the disciplines and the techniques of the courses a bit further. To do so, we looked for mentions of the disciplines and techniques in DH journal articles (we limited our search to abstracts) in order to give the users insight on the number and quality of publications related to specific disciplines and techniques. At the same time, we looked for mentions of the disciplines and techniques into job offers from data.world to let users know which skills are most sought after by potential employers.
