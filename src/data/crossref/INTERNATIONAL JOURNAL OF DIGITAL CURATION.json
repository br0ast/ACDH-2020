A number of projects have developed costing models for digital preservation but there remains a major problem with information assets (digital or otherwise) in that their value is difficult to express in terms that are readily understood by all the stakeholders, especially those who might fund their preservation. This paper introduces a range of issues concerning information value and business models for sustained funding of digital preservation, with particular reference to the espida Project recently completed at the University of Glasgow. This project has developed a model of information value that builds on the Balanced Scorecard approach to business performance developed by Kaplan and Norton. This model casts information curation as an investment where current and ongoing expenditure is incurred in order to produce future returns, benefitting a range of stakeholders. In this formulation, value is seen as multi-facetted and, from the point of view of the individual or organisation funding the curation, explicitly related to the funder\u2019s strategic goals. It also recognises that benefits may only accrue over the long term and that there is a risk that information that is preserved may fail to deliver any return. Examples discussed in the paper concern the establishment of an institutional repository and the establishment of an e-thesis service for an educational institution. It concludes that a deconstruction of benefits of this kind can be more quickly and fully understood even by stakeholders not necessarily expert in the curation field. This facilitates the production of a well-constructed case that clearly articulates information value and the benefit that accrues from its curation, which in turn allows senior management or other funders to make funding decisions based on understandable information: the basic premise of good practice in management. This is a commonly understood idea and one that the espida methodology helps fulfil.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v2i1.11", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 4, 13]], "date-time": "2010-04-13T15:19:00Z", "timestamp": 1271171940000}, "page": "12-28", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["The world is all grown digital....

It also details the approach taken by the SHERPA DP Project to introduce a disaggregated service model for institutional repositories that wish to implement preservation services.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v2i1.14", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 4, 13]], "date-time": "2010-04-13T15:19:00Z", "timestamp": 1271171940000}, "page": "62-72", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["Modelling OAIS Compliance for Disaggregated Preservation Services"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "2", "author": [{"given": "Gareth", "family": "Knight", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Mark", "family": "Hedges", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/25/14", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/25/14", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:27:40Z", "timestamp": 1515022060000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2007, 7, 27]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v2i1.14", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T11:45:06Z", "timestamp": 1574423106999}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Occupational information resources - data about the characteristics of different occupational positions - are widely used in the social sciences, across a range of disciplines and international contexts. They are available in many formats, most often constituting small electronic files that are made freely downloadable from academic web pages.

In this paper we describe features of occupational information resources, and indicate the role digital curation can play in exploiting them. We report upon the strategies used in the GEODE research project (Grid Enabled Occupational Data Environment1). This project attempts to develop long-term standards for the distribution of occupational information resources, by providing a standardized framework-based electronic depository for occupational information resources, and by providing a data indexing service, based on e-Science middleware, which collates occupational information resources and makes them readily accessible to non-specialist social scientists.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v2i1.15", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 4, 13]], "date-time": "2010-04-13T15:19:00Z", "timestamp": 1271171940000}, "page": "73-91", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 5, "title": ["Data Curation Standards and Social Science Occupational Information Resources"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "2", "author": [{"given": "Paul", "family": "Lambert", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Vernon", "family": "Gayle", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Larry", "family": "Tan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ken", "family": "Turner", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Richard", "family": "Sinnott", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ken", "family": "Prandy", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/26/15", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/26/15", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:27:36Z", "timestamp": 1515022056000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2007, 7, 27]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v2i1.15", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T11:45:07Z", "timestamp": 1574423107016}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The MIT Libraries, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, and the University of California San Diego Libraries are conducting the PLEDGE Project to determine the set of policies that affect operational digital preservation archives and to develop standardized means of recording and enforcing them using rules engines.

Its aim was to inform investment in order to provide a usable, useful, and accessible e-infrastructure for all researchers and a coherent set of e-infrastructure services that would increase usage by at least a factor of ten by 2010. Through a series of unstructured face-to-face interviews with over 45 participants from 30 different projects, an online survey, together with a day-long workshop at NeSC, we have observed recurring issues relating to the provision of e-infrastructure. In this article we focus on the data-related issues identified during these interactions. We conclude with a prioritised list of future activities for research, development, and adoption in the data space.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v2i1.23", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 4, 13]], "date-time": "2010-04-13T15:19:00Z", "timestamp": 1271171940000}, "page": "149-155", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["User Priorities for Data: Results from SUPER"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "2", "author": [{"given": "Jennifer M.", "family": "Schopf", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Steven", "family": "Newhouse", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/34/23", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/34/23", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:27:13Z", "timestamp": 1515022033000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2007, 7, 27]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v2i1.23", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T11:44:18Z", "timestamp": 1574423058598}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of digital technologies within research has led to a proliferation of data, many new forms of research output and new modes of presentation and analysis. Many scientific communities are struggling with the challenge of how to manage the terabytes of data and new forms of output, they are producing. They are also under increasing pressure from funding organizations to publish their raw data, in addition to their traditional publications, in open archives. In this paper I describe an approach that involves the selective encapsulation of raw data, derived products, algorithms, software and textual publications within \u201cscientific publication packages\u201d. Such packages provide an ideal method for: encapsulating expert knowledge; for publishing and sharing scientific process and results; for teaching complex scientific concepts; and for the selective archival, curation and preservation of scientific data and output. They also provide a bridge between technological advances in the Digital Libraries and eScience domains. In particular, I describe the RDF-based architecture that we are adopting to enable scientists to construct, publish and manage \u201cscientific publication packages\u201d - compound digital objects that encapsulate and relate the raw data to its derived products, publications and the associated contextual, provenance and administrative metadata.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v1i1.4", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 4, 13]], "date-time": "2010-04-13T13:48:37Z", "timestamp": 1271166517000}, "page": "33-52", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 16, "title": ["Scientific Publication Packages \u2013 A Selective Approach to the Communication and Archival of Scientific Output"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "1", "author": [{"given": "Jane", "family": "Hunter", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8/4", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8/4", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:28:10Z", "timestamp": 1515022090000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v1i1.4", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T11:44:18Z", "timestamp": 1574423058607}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>A report on an invitational workshop held in Washington, D.C. on the 7-9 May 2006; organised by the Joint Information Systems Committee and the US National Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v1i1.6", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 4, 13]], "date-time": "2010-04-13T13:48:37Z", "timestamp": 1271166517000}, "page": "60-76", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Joint US-UK Digital Preservation Workshop, Washington, D.C., May 7-9, 2006"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "1", "author": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Day", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Helen", "family": "Hockx-Yu", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10/6", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10/6", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:28:03Z", "timestamp": 1515022083000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v1i1.6", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T11:44:18Z", "timestamp": 1574423058605}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The creation, management and use of digital materials are of increasing importance for a wide range of activities.

The paper explores this emerging field of digital curation as an area of inter-disciplinary research and practice, and the trends which are influencing its development. It analyses the genesis of the term and how traditional roles relating to digital assets are in transition. Finally it explores some of the drivers for curation ranging from trends such as exponential growth in digital information, to \"life-caching\", digital preservation, the Grid and new opportunities for publishing, sharing, and re-using data. It concludes that significant effort needs to be put into developing a persistent information infrastructure for digital materials and into developing the digital curation skills of researchers and information professionals. Without this, current investment in digitisation and digital content will only secure short-term rather than lasting benefits.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v1i1.2", "type": "journal-article",

Yet a one-size-fits-all 'all rights reserved' copyright regime clearly fails to meet the requirements of many rightsholders. One response has been the Creative Commons movement which seeks, through licences based on existing copyright laws, to provide a simple mechanism for rightsholders to disseminate their works under less restrictive conditions. The Creative Commons' initial success has led to suggestions that its principles could be equally applied to scientific research outputs, such as publications, licensing of research materials, and datasets. This article argues that the Science Commons approach, if based on the Creative Commons model, and premised at its root on utilitarian copyright law, will both fail to address contemporary policy drivers in research, or to provide researchers with the type of rights that they actually want. It suggests that constructing an appropriate set of rights for the Science Commons, particularly for datasets, will require a willingness to step outside the utilitarian model and look to the Continental copyright tradition, which sets less store in economic rights and gives greater weight to moral rights.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v1i1.3", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 4, 13]], "date-time": "2010-04-13T13:48:37Z", "timestamp": 1271166517000}, "page": "17-32", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["Digital Curation, Copyright, and Academic Research"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "1", "author": [{"given": "Andrew", "family": "Charlesworth", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/7/3", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/7/3", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:28:13Z", "timestamp": 1515022093000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v1i1.3", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474067}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Kevin Ashley, Chief Editor, introduces Volume 6, Issue 2 (2011) of the International Journal of Digital Curation.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.189", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "1-3", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Editorial"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Kevin", "family": "Ashley", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 7, 25]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/180/249", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/180/249", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:20:52Z", "timestamp": 1515021652000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 7, 25]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 10, 7]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.189", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474073}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores how researchers at a major Midwestern university are managing their data, as well as the factors that have shaped their practices and those that motivate or inhibit changes to that practice.

Similarly, and reflecting a popular interest in the histories of digital games, exhibitions such as Game On (Barbican, UK) and GameCity (Nottingham, UK) experiment with ways of presenting games to a general audience. This article focuses on the UK\u2019s National Videogame Archive (NVA) which, since its foundation in 2008, has developed approaches that both dovetail with and critique existing strategies to game preservation, exhibition and display.The article begins by noting the NVA\u2019s interest in preserving not only the code or text of the game, but also the experience of using it \u2013 that is, the preservation of gameplay as well as games. This approach is born of a conceptualisation of digital games as what Moulthrop (2004) has called \u201cconfigurative performances\u201d that are made through the interaction of code, systems, rules and, essentially, the actions of players at play. The analysis develops by problematising technical solutions to game preservation by exploring the way seemingly minute differences in code execution greatly impact on this user experience.Given these issues, the article demonstrates how the NVA returns to first principles and questions the taken-for-granted assumption that the playable game is the most effective tool for interpretation. It also encourages a consideration of the uses of non-interactive audiovisual and (para)textual materials in game preservation activity. In particular, the focus falls upon player-produced walkthrough texts, which are presented as archetypical archival documents of gameplay. The article concludes by provocatively positing that these non-playable, non-interactive texts might be more useful to future game scholars than the playable game itself.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.206", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "109-127", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 7, "title": ["(Not) Playing Games: Player-Produced Walkthroughs as Archival Documents of Digital Gameplay"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "James", "family": "Newman", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 8, 19]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/186/266", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/186/266", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:19:59Z", "timestamp": 1515021599000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 8, 19]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 10, 7]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.206", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474150}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Telehealth monitoring data is now being collected across large populations of patients with chronic diseases such as stroke, hypertension, COPD and dementia.

While DigCCurr has been reported by its creators, a group of seasoned digital curation professionals and educators from around the world, this paper provides a fresh perspective from graduates of the program who are applying their newly learned digital curation skills and knowledge in the workforce.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.195", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "176-194", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 4, "title": ["Digital Curation Education in Practice: Catching up with Two Former Fellows"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Lisa", "family": "Gregory", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Samantha", "family": "Guss", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 7, 25]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/190/255", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/190/255", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:20:33Z", "timestamp": 1515021633000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 7, 25]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 10, 7]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.195", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474170}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The preparation and publication of dissertations can be viewed as a subsystem of scholarly communication, and the treatment of data that support doctoral research can be mapped in a very controlled manner to the data curation lifecycle.

As original systems cease to work because of hardware and media failures, methods to preserve obsolete video games for future generations have to be developed. The public interest in early video games is high, as exhibitions, regular magazines on the topic and newspaper articles demonstrate. Moreover, games considered to be classic are rereleased for new generations of gaming hardware. However, with the rapid development of new computer systems, the way games look and are played changes constantly. When trying to preserve console video games one faces problems of classified development documentation, legal aspects and extracting the contents from original media like cartridges with special hardware. Furthermore, special controllers and non-digital items are used to extend the gaming experience making it difficult to preserve the look and feel of console video games.This paper discusses strategies for the digital preservation of console video games. After a short overview of console video game systems, there follows an introduction to digital preservation and related work in common strategies for digital preservation and preserving interactive art. Then different preservation strategies are described with a specific focus on emulation. Finally a case study on console video game preservation is shown which uses the Planets preservation planning approach for evaluating preservation strategies in a documented decision-making process. Experiments are carried out to compare different emulators as well as other approaches, first for a single console video game system, then for different console systems of the same era and finally for systems of all eras. Comparison and discussion of results show that, while emulation works very well in principle for early console video games, various problems exist for the general use as a digital preservation alternative.

Secondly the development of a model of software artefacts, describing the basic components of all software, loosely based on the FRBR model for representing digital artefacts and their history within a library context. Finally, the definition and categorisation of the properties of software artefacts which are required to ensure that the software product has been adequately preserved. These are broken down into a number of categories and related to the concepts defined in the OAIS standard.

Using existing high-speed educational and research networks and mass-scale storage infrastructure investments, the partnership is leveraging the data storage capabilities at SDSC, NCAR, and UMIACS to provide a preservation data grid that emphasizes heterogeneous and highly redundant data storage systems.In this paper we will explore the major themes within Chronopolis, including:a) The philosophy and theory behind a nationally federated data grid for preservation. b) The core tools and technologies used in Chronopolis. c) The metadata schema that is being developed within Chronopolis for all of the data elements. d) Lessons learned from the first year of the project.e) Next steps in digital preservation using Chronopolis: how we plan to strengthen and broaden our network with enhanced services and new customers.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v5i1.147", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "119-133", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["Chronopolis Digital Preservation Network"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "5", "author": [{"given": "David", "family": "Minor", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Don", "family": "Sutton", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ardys", "family": "Kozbial", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Brad", "family": "Westbrook", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Burek", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Smorul", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2010, 6, 22]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/150/212", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/150/212", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:22:21Z", "timestamp": 1515021741000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2010, 6, 22]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2010, 7, 21]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v5i1.147", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474262}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we present the Core Scientific Metadata Model (CSMD), a model for the representation of scientific study metadata developed within the Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council (STFC) to represent the data generated from scientific facilities.

We give some motivations behind the development of the model, and an overview of its major structural elements, centred on the notion of a scientific study formed by a collection of specific investigations. We give some details of the model, with the description of each investigation associated with a particular experiment on a sample generating data, and the associated data holdings are then mapped to the investigation with the appropriate parameters. We then go on to discuss the instantiation of the metadata model within a production quality data management infrastructure, the Information CATalogue (ICAT), which has been developed within STFC for use in large-scale photon and neutron sources. Finally, we give an overview of the relationship between CSMD, and other initiatives, and give some directions for future developments. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v5i1.146", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "106-118", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 23, "title": ["Using a Core Scientific Metadata Model in Large-Scale Facilities"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "5", "author": [{"given": "Brian", "family": "Matthews", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Shoaib", "family": "Sufi", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Damian", "family": "Flannery", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Laurent", "family": "Lerusse", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Tom", "family": "Griffin", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Gleaves", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Kerstin", "family": "Kleese", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2010, 6, 22]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/149/211", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/149/211", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:22:24Z", "timestamp": 1515021744000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2010, 6, 22]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2010, 7, 21]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v5i1.146", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474280}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>For years, discussions of digital preservation have routinely featured comments such as \u201cbit preservation is a solved problem; the real issues are ...\u201d.

We demonstrate that even simple scripts can reduce impediments to casual use of the digital objects being preserved.

EO Space Missions provide global coverage of the Earth across both space and time generating on a routine continuous basis huge amounts of data (from a variety of sensors) that need to be acquired, processed, elaborated, appraised and archived by dedicated systems. Long-term Preservation of these data and of the ability to discover, access and process them is a fundamental issue and a major challenge at programmatic, technological and operational levels.Moreover these data are essential for scientists needing broad series of data covering long time periods and from many sources. They are used for many types of investigations including ones of international importance such as the study of the Global Change and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) Program. Therefore it is of primary importance not only to guarantee easy accessibility of historical data but also to ensure users are able to understand and use them; in fact data interpretation can be even more complicated given the fact that scientists may not have (or may not have access to) the right knowledge to interpret these data correctly.To satisfy these requirements, the European Space Agency (ESA), in addition to other internal initiatives, is participating in several EU-funded projects such as CASPAR (Cultural, Artistic, and Scientific knowledge for Preservation, Access and Retrieval), which is building a framework to support the end-to-end preservation lifecycle for digital information, based on the OAIS reference model, with a strong focus on the preservation of the knowledge associated with data.In the CASPAR Project ESA plays the role of both user and infrastructure provider for one of the scientific testbeds, putting into effect dedicated scenarios with the aim of validating the CASPAR solutions in the Earth Science domain. The other testbeds are in the domains of Cultural Heritage and of Contemporary Performing Arts; together they provide a severe test of preservation tools and techniques.In the context of the current ESA overall strategies carried out in collaboration with European EO data owners/providers, entities and institutions which have the objective of guaranteeing long-term preservation of EO data and knowledge, this paper will focus on the ESA participation and contribution to the CASPAR Project, describing in detail the implementation of the ESA scientific testbed.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v4i3.127", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "4-16", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["Long-term Preservation of Earth Observation Data and Knowledge in ESA through CASPAR"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "Sergio", "family": "Albani", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "David", "family": "Giaretta", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 12, 7]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/130/162", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/130/162", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:22:47Z", "timestamp": 1515021767000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 12, 7]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 12, 7]]}, "issue": "3"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v4i3.127", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474379}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "3", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>In the highly competitive engineering industry, product innovations are created with the help of a product lifecycle management (PLM) tool chain.

Due to the product\u2019s complexity, the design of a product not only consists of geometry data but also of valuable engineering knowledge that is created during the various PLM phases. The need to preserve such intellectual capital leads engineering companies to introduce knowledge management and archiving their machine-readable formal representation. However, archived knowledge is in danger of becoming unusable since it is very likely that knowledge semantics and knowledge representation will evolve over long time periods, for example during the 50 operational years of some products. Knowledge evolution and knowledge representation technology changes are crucial issues since a reuse of the archived product information can only be ensured if its rationale and additional knowledge are interpretable with future software and technologies. Therefore, in order to reuse design data fully, knowledge about the design must also be migrated to be interoperable with future design systems and knowledge representation methods.

The kind of generic vision for data sharing that is currently promoted by national agencies is judged to be neither productive nor effective.\u00a0 Only close engagement with research practitioners in the identification of bottom-up strategies that preserve the exercise of informed choice - a fundamental and persistent element of scientific research - will produce change on a national scale.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v4i3.115", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "71-82", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 21, "title": ["Multi-scale Data Sharing in the Life Sciences: Some Lessons for Policy Makers"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "Graham", "family": "Pryor", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 12, 7]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/135/178", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/135/178", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:23:16Z", "timestamp": 1515021796000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 12, 7]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 12, 7]]}, "issue": "3"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v4i3.115", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474417}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "3", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p> Developmental Gene Expression Map (DGEMap) is an EU-funded Design Study, which will accelerate an integrated European approach to gene expression in early human development.

He maintains that the archival literature is a rich source for discussions of authenticity that has been ignored to the detriment of Jantz\u2019s arguments.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v4i2.100", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "4-7", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Letter to the Editor: Authentic Digital Objects"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "Andrew", "family": "Wilson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/113/100", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/113/100", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:24:07Z", "timestamp": 1515021847000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v4i2.100", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474487}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Chris Rusbridge, Chief Editor, introduces Volume 4, Issue 2 (2009) of the International Journal of Digital Curation.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v4i2.99", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "1-3", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Editorial"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "Chris", "family": "Rusbridge", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/112/116", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/112/116", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:24:10Z", "timestamp": 1515021850000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v4i2.99", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474499}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>    This letter responds to Andrew Wilson\u2019s concerns regarding my article in IJDC 4(1) entitled \u201cAn Institutional Framework for Creating Authentic Digital Objects\u201d.

Therefore the TextGridLab provides common functionalities in a sustainable environment to intensify re-use of data, tools, and services, and the TextGridRep enables researchers to publish and share their data in a way that supports long-term availability and re-usability.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.198", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "222-231", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 10, "title": ["TextGrid \u2013 Virtual Research Environment for the Humanities"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Heike", "family": "Neuroth", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Felix", "family": "Lohmeier", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Kathleen Marie", "family": "Smith", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 7, 25]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/193/258", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/193/258", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:20:25Z", "timestamp": 1515021625000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 7, 25]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 10, 7]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.198", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474611}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS), the Dutch scientific data archive for the social sciences and humanities, is engaged in the Migration to Intermediate XML for Electronic Data (MIXED) project to develop open source software that implements the smart migration strategy concerning the long-term archiving of file formats. Smart migration concerns the conversion upon ingest of specific kinds of data formats, such as spreadsheets and databases, to an intermediate XML formatted file. It is assumed that the long-term curation of the XML files is much less problematic than the migration of binary source files and that the intermediate XML file can be converted in an efficient way to file formats that are common in the future. The features of the intermediate XML files are stored in the so-called Standard Data Formats for Preservation (SDFP) specification. This XML schema can be considered an umbrella as it contains existing formal descriptions of file formats developed by others. SDFP also contain schemata developed by DANS, for example, a schema for file-oriented databases. It can be used, for example, for the binary DataPerfect format, that was used on a large scale about twenty years ago, and for which no existing XML schema could be found. The software developed in the MIXED project has been set up as a generic framework, together with a number of plug-ins. It can be considered as a repository of durable file format conversions. This paper contains an overview of the results of the MIXED project.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.200", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "245-252", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Migration to Intermediate XML for Electronic Data (MIXED): Repository of Durable File Format Conversions"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Ren\u00e9", "family": "Van Horik", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Dirk", "family": "Roorda", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 7, 25]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/195/260", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/195/260", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:20:18Z", "timestamp": 1515021618000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 7, 25]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 10, 7]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.200", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:54Z", "timestamp": 1574436474612}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>During the last decade, national and international attention has been increasingly focused on issues of research data management and access to publicly funded research data.

The key difference between our approach and that of other Managing Research Data projects is the type of infrastructure we are piloting. While the majority of these projects focus on developing technical solutions, we are focusing on the need for \u2018soft\u2019 infrastructure, such as one-to-one tailored support, training, and easy-to-find, concise guidance that breaks down some of the barriers information professionals have unintentionally built with their use of specialist terminology.We are employing a bottom-up approach as we feel that to support the step-by-step development of sound research data management practices, you must first understand researchers\u2019 needs and perspectives. Over the life of the project, Incremental staff will act as mediators, assisting researchers and local support staff to understand the data management requirements within which they are expect to work, and will determine how these can be addressed within research workflows and the existing technical infrastructure.Our primary goal is to build data management capacity within the Universities of Cambridge and Glasgow by raising awareness of basic principles so everyone can manage their data to a certain extent. We will ensure our lessons can be picked up and used by other institutions.

It aimed to develop and demonstrate the potential of diverse, low cost sensors to provide heterogeneous data for the planning, management and control of the environmental impacts of transport activity at urban, regional and national level. During the last year of the project, the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) interviewed and observed members of the project team in order to identify and analyse key aspects of their data-related activities, recording attitudes towards the data that they create and/or re-use. This paper describes the major issues identified over the course of the case study, which are presented in parallel with the perspectives of the project team in order to demonstrate the multiplicity of views that may be projected onto a single dataset. It concludes with a contextualisation of the case study's themes with those of a number of contemporary reports.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.170", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "32-44", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["The Milieu and the MESSAGE: Talking to Researchers about Data Curation Issues in a Large and Diverse e-Science Project"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Martin", "family": "Donnelly", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Robin", "family": "North", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 8]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/161/229", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/161/229", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:21:47Z", "timestamp": 1515021707000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 8]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 11]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.170", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:55Z", "timestamp": 1574436475365}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>As collections become larger in size, more complex in structure and increasingly diverse in composition, new approaches are needed to help curators assess digital files and make decisions about their long-term preservation.

The case study collection contains over 1,000,000 files of diverse formats arranged in varied record structures and record groups. The visualization application uses tree maps and a relational database management system (RDBMS) to represent the collection's arrangement and to show available characterization information at different levels of aggregation, classification and abstraction. Through this visualization interface curators can interact dynamically with the collections' characterization information to discover trends, as well as compare and contrast various file characteristics across the collection. Curators may select and weight the variables that they want to analyze. They can pursue analysis workflows that go from a high-level overview of the collection's preservation condition based on file format risks, to obtaining more detailed results about the condition of record groups and individual records. While there are various digital preservation planning tools available, to our knowledge none have been designed specifically to visually present assessment information across vast and complex collections.

With the current pace of technological development, any system can become obsolete in a matter of years and hence the data stored in a specific storage media might not be accessible anymore due to the unavailability of the system to access the media. In order to preserve digital records residing in such storage media, it is necessary to extract the data stored in those media by some means.One early storage medium for home computers in the 1980s was audio tape. The first home computer systems allowed the use of standard cassette players to record and replay data. Audio cassettes are more durable than old home computers when properly stored. Devices playing this medium (i.e. tape recorders) can be found in working condition or can be repaired, as they are usually made out of standard components. By re-engineering the format of the waveform and the file formats, the data on such media can then be extracted from a digitised audio stream and migrated to a non-obsolete format.In this paper we present a case study on extracting the data stored on an audio tape by an early home computer system, namely the Philips Videopac+ G7400. The original data formats were re-engineered and an application was written to support the migration of the data stored on tapes without using the original system. This eliminates the necessity of keeping an obsolete system alive for enabling access to the data on the storage media meant for this system. Two different methods to interpret the data and eliminate possible errors in the tape were implemented and evaluated on original tapes, which were recorded 20 years ago. Results show that with some error correction methods, parts of the tapes are still readable even without the original system. It also implies that it is easier to build solutions while original systems are still available in a working condition.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.174", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "79-98", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Migrating Home Computer Audio Waveforms to Digital Objects: A Case Study on Digital Archaeology"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Mark", "family": "Guttenbrunner", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Mihai", "family": "Ghete", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Annu", "family": "John", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Chrisanth", "family": "Lederer", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Andreas", "family": "Rauber", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 8]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/165/233", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/165/233", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:21:36Z", "timestamp": 1515021696000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 8]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 11]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.174", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:55Z", "timestamp": 1574436475515}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Emulation has been widely discussed as a preservation strategy for digital documents that depend upon proprietary executables, as well as for legacy programs.

Most of this work has taken place as research activity (often financed by government agencies) within libraries and information/computer science departments. Many projects focus on one format of information, such as research publications or data, potentially de-contextualizing individual records. Meanwhile, most institutional archives and manuscript repositories, which possess a rich theoretical and practical framework for preserving context among mixed analog materials, have failed to extend their capabilities to digital records. As a result, relatively few institutions have implemented systematic methods to capture, preserve and provide access to the complete range of documentation that end users need to understand and interpret past human activity.The Practical E-Records Method attempts to address this problem by providing easy-to-implement software reviews, guidance/policy templates, and program recommendations that blend digital curation research findings with traditional archival processes and workflows. Using the method discussed in this paper, archives and manuscript repositories can use existing resources to incrementally develop digital curation skills, building a collaborative, expanding program in the process. Archival programs that make digital curation a systematic institutional function will systematically gather, preserve, and provide access to genres of documentation that are contextually-rich and highly susceptible to loss, complementing efforts undertaken by librarians, information scientists and external service providers.

In the work discussed, the meaning of markup in a document is taken as the set of things accepted as true because of the markup's presence, or equivalently, as the set of inferences licensed by the markup in the document. It is possible, in principle, to apply a general semantic description of a markup vocabulary to documents encoded using that vocabulary and to generate a set of inferences (typically rather large, but finite) as a result. An ideal format conversion translating a digital object from one vocabulary to another, then, can be characterized as one which neither adds nor drops any licensed inferences; it is possible to check this equivalence explicitly for a given conversion of a digital object, and possible in principle (although probably beyond current capabilities in practice) to prove that a given transformation will, if given valid and semantically correct input, always produce output that is semantically equivalent to its input. This approach is directly applicable to the XML formats frequently used for scientific and other data, but it is also easily generalized from SGML/XML-based markup languages to digital formats in general; at a high level, it is equally applicable to document markup, to database exchanges, and to ad hoc formats for high-volume scientific data.Some obvious complications and technical difficulties arising from this approach are discussed, as are some important implications. In most real-world format conversions, the source and target formats differ at least somewhat in their ontology, either in the level of detail they cover or in the way they carve reality into classes; it is thus desirable not only to define what a perfect format conversion looks like, but to quantify the loss or distortion of information resulting from the conversion.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.179", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "153-164", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 4, "title": ["What Constitutes Successful Format Conversion?

Here the requirement for information is now greater than the effort that any single institution can put into gathering and collating this information. Recognising that more is better, the creators of PRONOM, JHOVE, GDFR and others are joining to lead a new initiative: the Unified Digital Format Registry. Ahead of this effort, a new RDF-based framework for structuring and facilitating file format data from multiple sources, including PRONOM, has demonstrated it is able to produce more links, and thus provide more answers to digital preservation questions - about format risks, applications, viewers and transformations - than the native data alone. This paper will describe this registry, P2, and its services, show how it can be used, and provide examples where it delivers more answers than the contributing resources. The P2 Registry is a reference platform to allow and encourage publication of preservation data, and also an examplar of what can be achieved if more data is published openly online as simple machine-readable documents.

For popular, well-defined and often open file formats \u2013 e.g., digital images, such as PNG, GIF, JPEG \u2013 a wide range of tools exist. Migration workflows become more difficult with proprietary formats, as used by the several text processing applications becoming available in the last two decades. If a certain file format can not be rendered with actual software, emulation of the original environment remains a valid option. For instance, with the original Lotus AmiPro or Word Perfect, it is not a problem to save an object of this type in ASCII text or Rich Text Format. In specific environments, it is even possible to send the file to a virtual printer, thereby producing a PDF as a migration output. Such manual migration tasks typically involve human interaction, which may be feasible for a small number of objects, but not for larger batches of files.We propose a novel approach using a software-operated VNC abstraction layer in order to replace humans with machine interaction. Emulators or virtualization tools equipped with a VNC interface are very well suited for this approach. But screen, keyboard and mouse interaction is just part of the setup. Furthermore, digital objects need to be transferred into the original environment in order to be extracted after processing. Nevertheless, the complexity of the new generation of migration services is quickly rising; a preservation workflow is now comprised not only of the migration tool itself, but of a complete software and virtual hardware stack with recorded workflows linked to every supported migration scenario. Thus the requirements of OAIS management must include proper software archiving, emulator selection, system image and recording handling. The concept of view-paths could help either to automatically determine the proper pre-configured virtual environment or to set up system images for certain migration workflows. View-paths may rise in demand, as the generation of PDF output files from Word Perfect input could be cached as pre-fabricated emulator system images. The current groundwork provides several possible optimizations, such as using the automation features of the original environments.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.181", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "183-198", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Automation of Flexible Migration Workflows"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Dirk", "family": "Von Suchodoletz", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Klaus", "family": "Rechert", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Randolph", "family": "Welte", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Maurice", "family": "Van den Dobbelsteen", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Bill", "family": "Roberts", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jeffrey", "family": "Van der Hoeven", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jasper", "family": "Schroder", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 8]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/172/240", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/172/240", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:21:15Z", "timestamp": 1515021675000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 8]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 11]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.181", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:56Z", "timestamp": 1574436476278}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Within information systems, a significant aspect of search and retrieval across information objects, such as datasets, journal articles, or images, relies on the identity construction of the objects.

Identity, in this context, can be seen as the foundation from which citations, metadata and identifiers are constructed.In recent years the idea of including datasets within the scientific record has been gaining significant momentum, with publishers, granting agencies and libraries engaging with the challenge.

The overall objective of the project was to increase cost effectiveness of digital preservation activities and to provide a basis for comparing and estimating future cost requirements for digital preservation. In this study we describe an activity-based costing methodology for digital preservation based on the Open Archice Information System (OAIS) Reference Model. Within this framework, which we denote the Cost Model for Digital Preservation (CMDP), the focus is on costing the functional entity Preservation Planning from the OAIS and digital migration activities. In order to estimate these costs we have identified cost-critical activities by analysing the functions in the OAIS model and the flows between them. The analysis has been supplemented with findings from the literature, and our own knowledge and experience. The identified cost-critical activities have subsequently been deconstructed into measurable components, cost dependencies have been examined, and the resulting equations expressed in a spreadsheet. Currently the model can calculate the cost of different migration scenarios for a series of preservation formats for text, images, sound, video, geodata, and spreadsheets. In order to verify the model it has been tested on cost data from two different migration projects at the Danish National Archives (DNA). The study found that the OAIS model provides a sound overall framework for the cost breakdown, but that some functions need additional detailing in order to cost activities accurately. Running the two sets of empirical data showed among other things that the model underestimates the cost of manpower-intensive migration projects, while it reinstates an often underestimated cost, which is the cost of developing migration software. The model has proven useful for estimating the costs of preservation planning and digital migrations. However, more work is needed to refine the existing equations and include the other functional entities of the OAIS model. Also the user-friendliness of the spreadsheet tool must be improved in future versions of the model. The CMDP is presently closing its second phase, where it has been extended to include the OAIS Functional Entity Ingest. This has also enabled us to adjust the theoretical model further, especially regarding the accuracy and precision of the model and in relation to the underlying parameters used in the equations, such as migration frequency and format complexity. Understanding the nature of digital preservation cost is prerequisite for increasing the overall efficiency, and achieving first quality for preservation of cultural heritage materials.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.186", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "255-267", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 7, "title": ["Cost Model for Digital Preservation: Cost of Digital Migration"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Ulla B\u00f8gvad", "family": "Kejser", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Anders Bo", "family": "Nielsen", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Alex", "family": "Thirifays", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 11]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/177/246", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/177/246", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:21:00Z", "timestamp": 1515021660000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 11]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 11]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.186", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:56Z", "timestamp": 1574436476451}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>In early 2009 the Planets project undertook a survey of national libraries, archives, and other content-holding organisations in Europe to better understand the organisations' digital preservation activities and needs, and to ensure that Planets' technology and services are designed to meet them.

Investigations revealed that it is not sufficient to archive only the product design data which is created in early PLM phases, but preservation is needed for data that is produced during the entire product lifecycle including early and late phases. Data that is relevant for preservation consists of requirements analysis documents, design rationale, data that reflects experiences during product operation and also metadata like social collaboration context. In addition, also the engineering environment itself that contains specific versions of all tools and services is a candidate for preservation. This paper takes a closer look at engineering preservation use case scenarios as well as PLM characteristics and workflows that are relevant for long-term preservation. Resulting requirements for a long-term preservation system lead to an OAIS (Open Archival Information System) based system architecture and a proposed preservation service interface that respects the needs of the engineering industry.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.188", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "282-296", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["Towards Support for Long-Term Digital Preservation in Product Life Cycle Management"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Wolfgang", "family": "Wilkes", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "J\u00f6rg", "family": "Brunsmann", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Dominic", "family": "Heutelbeck", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Andreas", "family": "Hundsd\u00f6rfer", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Matthias", "family": "Hemmje", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Hans-Ulrich", "family": "Heidbrink", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 11]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/179/248", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/179/248", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:20:55Z", "timestamp": 1515021655000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 11]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 11]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v6i1.188", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:56Z", "timestamp": 1574436476539}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Chris Rusbridge and Kevin Ashley introduce Issue 1, Volume 5</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v5i1.156", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "1-3", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Editorial"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "5", "author": [{"given": "Chris", "family": "Rusbridge", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Kevin", "family": "Ashley", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2010, 6, 24]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/142/225", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/142/225", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:21:59Z", "timestamp": 1515021719000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2010, 6, 24]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2010, 7, 21]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v5i1.156", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:56Z", "timestamp": 1574436476550}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital preservation aims to keep digital objects accessible over long periods of time, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of these digital objects.

We provide an analysis of those needs, and a set of conclusions that has led to some implementation decisions for ANDS.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v3i2.66", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "151-158", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Access to Data for eResearch: Designing the Australian National Data Service Discovery Services"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Andrew", "family": "Treloar", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ross", "family": "Wilkinson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/95/66", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/95/66", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:25:02Z", "timestamp": 1515021902000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v3i2.66", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:58Z", "timestamp": 1574436478170}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>A report from the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) / Regional eScience Collaborative Workshop, held at the eScience Institute in Edinburgh on June 12, 2008.

The study summarised here is of the Neuroimaging Group in the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Division of Psychiatry, which plays a leading role in eScience collaborations to improve the infrastructure for neuroimaging data integration and reuse. The Group also aims to address growing data storage and curation needs, given the capabilities afforded by new infrastructure. The study briefly reviews the policy context and current challenges to data integration and sharing in the neuroimaging field. It then describes how curation and preservation risks and opportunities for change were identified throughout the curation lifecycle; and their context appreciated through field study in the research site. The results are consistent with studies of neuroimaging eInfrastructure that emphasise the role of local data sharing and reuse practices. These sustain mutual awareness of datasets and experimental protocols through sharing peer to peer, and among senior researchers and students, enabling continuity in research and flexibility in project work.

Here we present three sample cases from our current research projects to illustrate areas in which we expect information specialists to make important contributions to biological research practice.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v2i2.27", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "31-40", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["Graduate Curriculum for Biological Information Specialists: A Key to Integration of Scale in Biology"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "2", "author": [{"given": "Carole L.", "family": "Palmer", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Bryan P.", "family": "Heidorn", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Dan", "family": "Wright", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Melissa H.", "family": "Cragin", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/42/27", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/42/27", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:26:59Z", "timestamp": 1515022019000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2007, 12, 11]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v2i2.27", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:58Z", "timestamp": 1574436478336}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The Planets Project is developing services and technology to address core challenges in digital preservation.

The common ones require libraries to access content through publishers, which invariably means libraries lose long-term control of the journals to which they have subscribed.

Digital preservation activities can only succeed if they go beyond the technical properties of digital objects. They must consider the strategy, policy, goals, and constraints of the institution that undertakes them and take into account the cultural and institutional framework in which data, documents and records are preserved. Furthermore, because organizations differ in many ways, a one-size-fits-all approach cannot be appropriate. Fortunately, organizations involved in digital preservation have created documents describing their policies, strategies, work-flows, plans, and goals to provide guidance. They also have skilled staff who are aware of sometimes unwritten considerations. Within Planets (Farquhar &amp; Hockx-Yu, 2007), a four-year project co-funded by the European Union to address core digital preservation challenges, we have analyzed preservation guiding documents and interviewed staff from libraries, archives, and data centres that are actively engaged in digital preservation. This paper introduces a conceptual model for expressing the core concepts and requirements that appear in preservation guiding documents. It defines a specific vocabulary that institutions can reuse for expressing their own policies and strategies. In addition to providing a conceptual framework, the model and vocabulary support automated preservation planning tools through an XML representation.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v4i2.102", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "119-134", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Modelling Organizational Preservation  Goals to Guide Digital Preservation"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "Angela", "family": "Dappert", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Adam", "family": "Farquhar", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/123/126", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/123/126", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:23:58Z", "timestamp": 1515021838000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v4i2.102", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:59Z", "timestamp": 1574436479354}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The Web runs at risk.

While archiving objects, and building meaningful collection for long-term preservation and access, have been well-understood practice for centuaries, digital objects present new issues. In the previous article (Shah, 2009) I identified a number of these issues related to digital objects, specifically digital videos of an ephemeral nature. I argued that while preserving such objects, adding contextual information is essential. One of the interesting challenges is to identify what to collect and preserve as contextual information. For ephemeral digital videos, I proposed to harvest four kinds of relevances and five kinds of contexts. In order to implement this proposal, I presented ContextMiner, a framework and a system to support digital video curation. In this article, I will take a closer look at ContextMiner, analyzing it for its functionalities and usability. This is done by usability inspection and content analysis. For the former, we simulated two curatorial tasks, asked our users (curators) to use ContextMiner, and provide us feedback on its usability and functionalities. For the latter, we mined a collection prepared by ContextMiner for its potential usage in preservation. Finally, I have summarized the lessons learned from developing and using our system, providing implications for digital library curators interested in collecting and preserving digital objects of an ephemeral nature.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v4i2.106", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "171-183", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["ContextMiner: Supporting the Mining of Contextual Information for Ephemeral Digital Video Preservation"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "Chirag", "family": "Shah", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/127/130", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/127/130", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:23:46Z", "timestamp": 1515021826000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10, 15]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v4i2.106", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:59Z", "timestamp": 1574436479382}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Chris Rusbridge, Director of the Digital Curation Centre and Chief Editor, introduces Issue 1 of Volume 4, 2009, of the  International Journal of Digital Curation.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v4i1.74", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "6-7", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Editorial"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "Chris", "family": "Rusbridge", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 6, 29]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/97/72", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/97/72", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:24:56Z", "timestamp": 1515021896000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 6, 29]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 6, 29]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v4i1.74", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:27:59Z", "timestamp": 1574436479381}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past 20 years, more than 100,000 CD-ROM titles have been published including thousands of collections of government documents and data.

This includes a re-articulation of its mission in terms of digital curation, rather than preservation; encouraging a programmatic, rather than a project-oriented approach to curation activities; and a renewed emphasis on services, rather than systems. This last shift was motivated by a desire to deprecate the centrality of the repository as place. Having the repository as the locus for curation activity has resulted in the deployment of a somewhat cumbersome monolithic system that falls short of desired goals for responsiveness to rapidly changing user needs and operational and administrative sustainability. The Program is pursuing a path towards a new curation environment based on the principle of devolving curation function to a set of small, simple, loosely coupled services. In considering this new infrastructure, the Program is relying upon a highly deliberative process starting from first principles drawn from library and archival science. This is followed by a stagewise progression of identifying core preservable values, devising strategies promoting those values, defining abstract services embodying those strategies, and, finally, developing systems that instantiate those services.

The Research Information Network (RIN) report, To share or not to share: Publication and quality assurance of research data outputs (June 2008), investigates whether or not researchers make their research data available to others and the issues they encounter when doing so. Importantly, it seeks to do this by seeking the perspectives of researchers themselves. This paper reflects on how this relates to the more top-down literature on the subject. The discussion of the significance of the RIN's main findings is correlated to the four themes of the RIN report. Firstly, it discusses some distinctions in the types of data that should be shared and preserved and what needs to done to do so effectively.

This resulted in a project that affects the entire\u00a0 government Web estate, with a solution leveraging the basic building blocks of the Internet (DNS) and the Web (HTTP and URIs) in a pragmatic way, to ensure that an infrastructure is in place to provide access to important information both now and in the future.   </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v4i1.82", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "107-124", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["UK Government Web Continuity:  Persisting Access through Aligning Infrastructures"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "Amanda", "family": "Spencer", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "John", "family": "Sheridan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "David", "family": "Thomas", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "David", "family": "Pullinger", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 6, 29]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/106/81", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/106/81", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:24:28Z", "timestamp": 1515021868000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 6, 29]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2009, 6, 29]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v4i1.82", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:28:00Z", "timestamp": 1574436480965}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper will describe the genesis and realisation of the Australian National Data Service (ANDS).

A cura\u00adtor in the digital realm may be said to have the same responsibilities as one in a traditional archival domain. However, with the mass production and spread of digital objects, it may be difficult to do all the work manually. In the present article this problem is considered in the area of digital video preservation. We show how this problem can be formulated and propose a framework for capturing contextual infor\u00admation for ephemeral digital video preservation. This proposal is realized in a system called ContextMiner, which allows us to cater to a digital curator's needs with its four components: digital video curation, collection visualization, browsing interfaces, and video harvesting and monitoring.

The adoption of \u201cnamed graphs\u201d to represent these compound objects enables provenance information to be captured via the typed relationships between the components.

Views of different granularity can be inferred automatically using SWRL (Semantic Web Rules Language) rules and an inferencing engine. SCOPE extends the Provenance Explorer tool and GUI by: 1) Adding an embedded web browser that can be used for incorporating objects discoverable via the Web; 2) Representing compound objects as Named Graphs, that can be saved in RDF, TriX, TriG or as an Atom syndication feed; 3) Enabling scientists to attach Creative Commons Licenses to the compound objects to specify how they may be re-used; 4) Enabling compound objects to be published as Fedora Object XML (FOXML) files within a Fedora digital library.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v3i2.55", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "4-18", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 8, "title": ["SCOPE: A Scientific Compound Object Publishing and Editing System"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Kwok", "family": "Cheung", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jane", "family": "Hunter", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Anna", "family": "Lashtabeg", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "John", "family": "Drennan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/84/55", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/84/55", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:25:34Z", "timestamp": 1515021934000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v3i2.55", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:28:01Z", "timestamp": 1574436481032}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Ensuring the long-term usability of engineering informatics (EI) artifacts is a challenge, particularly for products with longer lifecycles than the computing hardware and software used for their design and manufacture.

Study partners are based in Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The study found that, in many cases, digital works are not being preserved in a systematic way. This is partly because digital preservation entails more difficult copyright issues than preservation of non-digital material. All the surveyed countries have some form of exception for preservation activities. However, there is inconsistency in the details between the countries\u2019 laws and uncertainty in how they apply in the digital environment. None of the countries surveyed have a uniform national system yet for collecting digital materials. Technological protection measures and licensing arrangements may, in some cases, present significant practical barriers to preservation. Current approaches to address these barriers are ad hoc and include requesting permissions from individual rights holders and some use of model licence terms that permit preservation. Moreover, as yet, there are no effective solutions to the general issue of orphan works. Recommendations of the study include suggestions for drafting national policies and adapting laws to allow digital preservation to be undertaken as necessary, in accordance with international best practice standards, and for promoting national systems for the collection of digital materials by relevant state and national collecting institutions.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v3i2.61", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "103-111", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 5, "title": ["Digital Preservation and Copyright: An International Study"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "June M.", "family": "Besek", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jessica", "family": "Coates", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Brian", "family": "Fitzgerald", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Wilma", "family": "Mossink", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "William G.", "family": "LeFurgy", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Adrienne", "family": "Muir", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Mary", "family": "Rasenberger", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Christopher D.", "family": "Weston", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/90/61", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/90/61", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:25:16Z", "timestamp": 1515021916000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v3i2.61", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:28:01Z", "timestamp": 1574436481056}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Chris Rusbridge, Chief Editor, introduces the Summer 2008 issue of the International Journal of Digital Curation.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v3i1.37", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "1-3", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Editorial"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Chris", "family": "Rusbridge", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/75/37", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/75/37", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:26:28Z", "timestamp": 1515021988000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 8, 6]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v3i1.37", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:28:01Z", "timestamp": 1574436481107}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>A preservation environment manages communication from the past while communicating with the future.

Lessons learned indicate that interoperability is a challenge in all aspects of collaborative work.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v3i1.38", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2011-12-23T13:19:24Z", "timestamp": 1324646364000}, "page": "4-14", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["Evolving a Network of Networks: The Experience of Partnerships in the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Martha", "family": "Anderson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/59/38", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/59/38", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:26:25Z", "timestamp": 1515021985000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2008, 12, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2008, 8, 6]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v3i1.38", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:28:01Z", "timestamp": 1574436481137}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The success of eScience research depends not only upon effective collaboration between scientists and technologists but also upon the active involvement of data archivists.

As traces from multiple experiments over long periods of time are accommodated, the trails may be sub-graphs of one trace, or they may be the logical representation of a virtual experiment obtained by joining together traces that share common data.The project has been carried out within the Provenance Working Group of the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) NSF project.

All universities that receive block grants from the Higher Education Funding Councils in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are subject to the legislation. Recent cases where universities have received requests for data and other information generated by researchers, working in areas such as climate, have given rise to controversy and widespread concern in the research community. This paper examines some of those concerns, relating to responsibilities for the ownership and holding of information, for data and records management, and for the handling of requests under the legislation. It also considers the implications relating to personal data, and to information that may affect the commercial interests of universities operating in a competitive environment, or the interests of the many other organisations which may be involved in research partnerships with universities; and it outlines concerns about the possible impact on quality assurance, peer review, and scholarly discourse. Finally, the paper emphasises the need for support and training for researchers so that they become more aware of the legislation and its implications, and how to deal with requests when they arise.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v7i1.214", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 12]], "date-time": "2012-03-12T13:43:35Z", "timestamp": 1331559815000}, "page": "57-71", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Freedom of Information in the UK and its Implications for Research in the Higher Education Sector"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Michael", "family": "Jubb", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 9]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/204/273", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/204/273", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:19:38Z", "timestamp": 1515021578000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 9]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 12]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v7i1.214", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T21:47:44Z", "timestamp": 1574459264534}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>One morning we came in to work to find that one of our servers had made 1.5 million attempts to contact an external server in the preceding hour.

In the first, highly parallel sequencing facilities generate large quantities of sequence data. In the latter, loosely networked remote and field sensors produce intermittent streams of different data types. Yet both genomic and environmental sciences are said to be moving to data intensive research. This paper explores and contrasts data flow in these two domains in order to better understand how data intensive research is being done. Our case studies are next generation sequencing for genomics and environmental networked sensors.Our objective was to enrich understanding of the \u2018intensive\u2019 processes and properties of data intensive research through a \u2018sociology\u2019 of data using methods that capture the relational properties of data flows. Our key methodological innovation was the staging of events for practitioners with different kinds of expertise in data intensive research to participate in the collective annotation of visual forms. Through such events we built a substantial digital data archive of our own that we then analysed in terms of three traits of data flow: durability, replicability and metrology.Our findings are that analysing data flow with respect to these three traits provides better insight into how doing data intensive research involves people, infrastructures, practices, things, knowledge and institutions. Collectively, these elements shape the topography of data and condition how it flows. We argue that although much attention is given to phenomena such as the scale, volume and speed of data in data intensive research, these are measures of what we call \u2018extensive\u2019 properties rather than intensive ones. Our thesis is that extensive changes, that is to say those that result in non-linear changes in metrics, can be seen to result from intensive changes that bring multiple, disparate flows into confluence.If extensive shifts in the modalities of data flow do indeed come from the alignment of disparate things, as we suggest, then we advocate the staging of workshops and other events with the purpose of developing the \u2018missing\u2019 metrics of data flow.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v7i1.216", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 12]], "date-time": "2012-03-12T13:43:35Z", "timestamp": 1331559815000}, "page": "81-94", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 5, "title": ["Understanding the \u2018Intensive\u2019 in \u2018Data Intensive Research\u2019: Data Flows in Next Generation Sequencing and Environmental Networked Sensors"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Ruth", "family": "McNally", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Adrian", "family": "Mackenzie", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Allison", "family": "Hui", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jennifer", "family": "Tomomitsu", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 9]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/206/275", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/206/275", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:19:32Z", "timestamp": 1515021572000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 9]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 12]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v7i1.216", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T21:47:44Z", "timestamp": 1574459264562}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The capability to validate and view or play binary file formats, as well as to convert binary file formats to standard or current file formats, is critically important to the preservation of digital data and records. This paper describes the extension of context-free grammars from strings to binary files. Binary files are arrays of data types, such as long and short integers, floating-point numbers and pointers, as well as characters. The concept of an attribute grammar is extended to these context-free array grammars. This attribute grammar has been used to define a number of chunk-based and directory-based binary file formats. A parser generator has been used with some of these grammars to generate syntax checkers (recognizers) for validating binary file formats. Among the potential benefits of an attribute grammar-based approach to specification and parsing of binary file formats is that attribute grammars not only support format validation, but support generation of error messages during validation of format, validation of semantic constraints, attribute value extraction (characterization), generation of viewers or players for file formats, and conversion to current or standard file formats. The significance of these results is that with these extensions to core computer science concepts, traditional parser/compiler technologies can potentially be used as a part of a general, cost effective curation strategy for binary file formats.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v7i1.217", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 12]], "date-time": "2012-03-12T13:43:35Z", "timestamp": 1331559815000}, "page": "95-106", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Grammar-Based Specification and Parsing of Binary File Formats"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "William", "family": "Underwood", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 9]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/207/276", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/207/276", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:19:29Z", "timestamp": 1515021569000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 9]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3, 12]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v7i1.217", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T21:47:44Z", "timestamp": 1574459264567}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper reviews developments in funders\u2019 data management and sharing policies, and explores the extent to which they have affected practice.

These attributes are then used as evaluation criteria to compare storage container formats belonging to five common categories: formats for archiving selected content (e.g. tar, WARC), disk image formats that capture data for recovery or installation (partimage, dd raw image), these two types combined with a selected compression algorithm (e.g. tar+gzip),  formats that combine packing and compression (e.g. 7-zip), and forensic file formats for data analysis in criminal investigations (e.g. aff \u2013 Advanced Forensic File format). We present a general discussion of the storage container format landscape in terms of the attributes we discuss, and make a direct comparison between the three most promising archival formats: tar, WARC, and aff.

It is hoped that understanding the usage of workflows and developing a set of recommended best practices will lead to increased contribution of workflows to the public domain.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v7i2.232", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 12, 13]], "date-time": "2012-12-13T16:43:02Z", "timestamp": 1355416982000}, "page": "92-100", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 20, "title": ["Trends in Use of Scientific Workflows: Insights from a Public Repository and Recommendations for Best Practice"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Richard", "family": "Littauer", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Karthik", "family": "Ram", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Bertram", "family": "Lud\u00e4scher", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "William", "family": "Michener", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Rebecca", "family": "Koskela", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 10, 23]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/222/291", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/222/291", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:18:44Z", "timestamp": 1515021524000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 10, 23]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 12, 6]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v7i2.232", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T15:15:06Z", "timestamp": 1574522106799}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper will describe the efforts and findings of the JISC Data Management Skills Support Initiative (\u2018DaMSSI\u2019).

A synthesis of the training outputs of the projects was then carried out, which further investigated the generic versus discipline-specific considerations and other successful approaches to training that had been identified as a result of the projects\u2019 work. In addition we produced a series of career profiles to help illustrate the fact that data management is an essential component \u2013 in obvious and not-so-obvious ways \u2013 of a wide range of professions.We found that both models had potential for consistently and coherently describing data management skills training and embedding this within broader institutional postgraduate curricula. However, we feel that additional discipline-specific references to data management skills could also be beneficial for effective use of these models. Our synthesis work identified that the majority of core skills were generic across disciplines at the postgraduate level, with the discipline-specific approach showing its value in engaging the audience and providing context for the generic principles.Findings were fed back to SCONUL and Vitae to help in the refinement of their respective models, and we are working with a number of other projects, such as the DCC and the EC-funded Digital Curator Vocational Education Europe (DigCurV2) initiative, to investigate ways to take forward the training profiling work we have begun.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v7i2.233", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 12, 13]], "date-time": "2012-12-13T16:43:02Z", "timestamp": 1355416982000}, "page": "101-109", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 5, "title": ["The Data Management Skills Support Initiative: Synthesising Postgraduate Training in Research Data Management"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Laura", "family": "Molloy", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Kellie", "family": "Snow", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 10, 23]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/223/292", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/223/292", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:18:41Z", "timestamp": 1515021521000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 10, 23]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012, 12, 6]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v7i2.233", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T15:15:06Z", "timestamp": 1574522106812}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Management and curation of digital data has been becoming ever more important in a higher education and research environment characterised by large and complex data, demand for more interdisciplinary and collaborative work, extended funder requirements and use of e-infrastructures to facilitate new research methods and paradigms.

In the field of archaeology, a growing number of PDF files \u2013 containing the detailed results of fieldwork and research \u2013 are beginning to be deposited with digital archives such as the Archaeology Data Service (ADS). In the ADS\u2019 experience, the use of PDF/A has had benefits as well as drawbacks: the majority of PDF reports are now in a standard format better suited to longer-term access, however migrating to PDF/A and managing and ensuring reuse of these files is intensive, and fraught with potential pitfalls. Of these, perhaps the most serious has been an unreliability in PDF/A conformance by the wide range of tools and software now available. There are also practical and more theoretical implications for reuse which, as our discipline of archaeology alongside so many others rapidly becomes digitized, presents us with a large corpus of \u2018data\u2019 that is human readable, but may not be amenable to machine-based technologies such as NLP.

There is a need for data management solutions that can help curators with efficient and on-demand analyses of their collection so that they remain well-informed about its evolving characteristics. In this paper, we describe our efforts towards developing a workflow to leverage open science High Performance Computing (HPC) resources for routinely and efficiently conducting data management tasks on large collections. We demonstrate that HPC resources and techniques can significantly reduce the time for accomplishing critical data management tasks, and enable a dynamic archiving throughout the research process. We use a large archaeological data collection with a long and complex formation history as our test case. We share our experiences in adopting open science HPC resources for large-scale data management, which entails understanding usage of the open source HPC environment and training users.

The advantages scientific workflows offer include rapid and easy workflow design, software and data reuse, scalable execution, sharing and collaboration, and other advantages that altogether facilitate \u201creproducible science\u201d. In this context, provenance \u2013 information about the origin, context, derivation, ownership, or history of some artifact \u2013 plays a key role, since scientists are interested in examining and auditing the results of scientific experiments. However, in order to perform such analyses on scientific results as part of extended research collaborations, an adequate environment and tools are required. Concretely, the need arises for a repository that will facilitate the sharing of scientific workflows and their associated execution traces in an interoperable manner, also enabling querying and visualization. Furthermore, such functionality should be supported while taking performance and scalability into account. With this purpose in mind, we introduce PBase: a scientific workflow provenance repository implementing the ProvONE proposed standard, which extends the emerging W3C PROV standard for provenance data with workflow specific concepts. PBase is built on the Neo4j graph database, thus offering capabilities such as declarative and efficient querying. Our experiences demonstrate the power gained by supporting various types of queries for provenance data.

We use the transfer of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) archive to examine the emergence of a new workforce for scientific research data management. Many individuals with diverse educational backgrounds and domain experience are involved in SDSS data management: domain scientists, computer scientists, software and systems engineers, programmers, and librarians. These types of positions have been described using terms such as research technologist, data scientist, e-science professional, data curator, and more. The findings reported here are based on semi-structured interviews, ethnographic participant observation, and archival studies from 2011-2013. The library staff conducting the data storage and archiving of the SDSS archive faced two performance problems. The preservation specialist and the system administrator worked together closely to discover and implement solutions to the slow data transfer and verification processes. The team overcame these slow-downs by problem solving, working in a team, and writing code. The library team lacked the astronomy domain knowledge necessary to meet some of their preservation and curation goals. The case study reveals the variety of expertise, experience, and individuals essential to the SDSS data management process. A variety of backgrounds and educational histories emerge in the data managers studied. Teamwork is necessary to bring disparate expertise together, especially between those with technical and domain education. The findings have implications for data management education, policy and relevant stakeholders.

Our previous work on a Kepler curation package has demonstrated advantages that come from automating data curation pipelines by using workflow systems. However, manually designed curation workflows can be error-prone and inefficient due to a lack of user understanding of the workflow system, misuse of actors, or human error. Correcting problematic workflows is often very time-consuming. A more proactive workflow system can help users avoid such pitfalls. For example, static analysis before execution can be used to detect the potential problems in a workflow and help the user to improve workflow design. In this paper, we propose a declarative workflow approach that supports semi-automated workflow design, analysis and optimization. We show how the workflow design engine helps users to construct data curation workflows, how the workflow analysis engine detects different design problems of workflows and how workflows can be optimized by exploiting parallelism.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v9i2.337", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10, 30]], "date-time": "2014-10-30T11:37:29Z", "timestamp": 1414669049000}, "page": "111-122", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Towards Automated Design, Analysis and Optimization of Declarative Curation Workflows"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "9", "author": [{"given": "Tianhong", "family": "Song", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Sven", "family": "Ko\u0308hler", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Bertram", "family": "Lud\u00e4scher", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "James", "family": "Hanken", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Maureen", "family": "Kelly", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "David", "family": "Lowery", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "James A.", "family": "Macklin", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Paul J.", "family": "Morris", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Robert A.", "family": "Morris", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10, 29]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.2.111/373", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.2.111/373", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:14:31Z", "timestamp": 1515021271000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10, 29]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i2.337", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T18:14:05Z", "timestamp": 1574705645899}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Research data is being generated at an ever-increasing rate.

By developing and testing a rubric designed to understand and evaluate the content of DMPs, the authors intend to develop a more complete understanding, at a larger scale, of how researchers plan for managing, sharing, and archiving their data.\u00a0</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v11i1.423", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 6]], "date-time": "2016-10-06T09:24:07Z", "timestamp": 1475745847000}, "page": "53-67", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["Using Data Management Plans to Explore Variability in Research Data Management Practices Across Domains"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "Susan Wells", "family": "Parham", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jake", "family": "Carlson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Patricia", "family": "Hswe", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Brian", "family": "Westra", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Amanda", "family": "Whitmire", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 5]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/11.1.53/422", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/11.1.53/422", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:12:04Z", "timestamp": 1515021124000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 5]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 6]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v11i1.423", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T18:14:06Z", "timestamp": 1574705646803}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>As scientific data volumes, format types, and sources increase rapidly with the invention and improvement of scientific capabilities, the resulting datasets are becoming more complex to manage as well. One of the significant management challenges is pulling apart the individual contributions of specific people and organizations within large, complex projects. This is important for two aspects: 1) assigning responsibility and accountability for scientific work, and 2) giving professional credit to individuals (e.g. hiring, promotion, and tenure) who work within such large projects. This paper aims to review the extant practice of data attribution and how it may be improved. Through a case study of creating a detailed attribution record for a climate model dataset, the paper evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the current data attribution method and proposes an alternative attribution framework accordingly. The paper concludes by demonstrating that, analogous to acknowledging the different roles and responsibilities shown in movie credits, the methodology developed in the study could be used in general to identify and map out the relationships among the organizations and individuals who had contributed to a dataset.\u00a0 As a result, the framework could be applied to create data attribution for other dataset types beyond climate model datasets.\u00a0\u00a0</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v11i1.357", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 6]], "date-time": "2016-10-06T09:24:07Z", "timestamp": 1475745847000}, "page": "33-52", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Recognizing the Diversity of Contributions: A Case Study for Framing Attribution and Acknowledgement for Scientific Data"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "Chung-Yi", "family": "Hou", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Matthew", "family": "Mayernik", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 5]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/11.1.33/421", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/11.1.33/421", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:12:07Z", "timestamp": 1515021127000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 5]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 6]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v11i1.357", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T18:14:06Z", "timestamp": 1574705646809}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Scholars at the ten campuses of the University of California system, like their academic peers elsewhere, increasingly are being asked to ensure that data resulting from their research and teaching activities are subject to effective long-term management, public discovery, and retrieval. The new academic imperative for research data management (RDM) stems from mandates from public and private funding agencies, pre-publication requirements, institutional policies, and evolving norms of scholarly discourse. In order to meet these new obligations, scholars need access to appropriate disciplinary and institutional tools, services, and guidance. When providing help in these areas, it is important that service providers recognize the disparity in scholarly familiarity with data curation concepts and practices. While the UC Curation Center (UC3) at the California Digital Library supports a growing roster of innovative curation services for University use, most were intended originally to meet the needs of institutional information professionals, such as librarians, archivists, and curators. In order to address the new curation concerns of individual scholars, UC3 realized that it needed to deploy new systems and services optimized for stakeholders with widely divergent experiences, expertise, and expectations. This led to the development of Dash, an online data publication service making campus data sharing easy. While Dash gives the appearance of being a full-fledged repository, in actuality it is only a lightweight overlay layer that sits on top of standards-compliant repositories, such as UC3\u2019s existing Merritt curation repository. The Dash service offers intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces for dataset submission, description, publication, and discovery. By imposing minimal prescriptive eligibility and submission requirements; automating and hiding the mechanical details of DOI assignment, data packaging, and repository deposit; and featuring a streamlined, self-service user experience that can be integrated easily into scholarly workflows, Dash is an important new service offering with which UC scholars can meet their RDM obligations.\u00a0 </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v11i1.408", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 6]], "date-time": "2016-10-06T09:24:07Z", "timestamp": 1475745847000}, "page": "118-127", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["Dash: Data Sharing Made Easy at the University of California"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "Stephen", "family": "Abrams", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "John", "family": "Kratz", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Stephanie", "family": "Simms", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Marisa", "family": "Strong", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Perry", "family": "Willett", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 5]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/11.1.118/428", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/11.1.118/428", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:11:45Z", "timestamp": 1515021105000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 5]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10, 6]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v11i1.408", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T18:14:07Z", "timestamp": 1574705647006}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p> This article extends previous work known as Preserving Virtual Worlds II (PVWII), funded through a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

The larger and longer term the research project, the more likely that scientists are to have resources and dedicated staff to manage their technology and data, leaving those scientists whose work is based on smaller and shorter term projects at a disadvantage. The volume and variety of data to be managed varies by many factors, only two of which are the number of collaborators and length of the project. As part of an NSF project to conceptualize the Institute for Empowering Long Tail Research, we explored opportunities offered by Software as a Service (SaaS). These cloud-based services are popular in business because they reduce costs and labor for technology management, and are gaining ground in scientific environments for similar reasons. We studied three settings where scientists conduct research in small and medium-sized laboratories. Two were NSF Science and Technology Centers (CENS and C-DEBI) and the third was a workshop of natural reserve scientists and managers.

CombeChem instigated a range of activities that have since been underway for more than ten years, in many ways matching the expansion of interest in using the Web as a vehicle for collection, curation, dissemination, reuse, and exploitation of scientific data and information. Chemistry has frequently provided the exemplar case studies, notably for the series of projects \u2013 funded by Jisc and EPSRC \u2013 that investigated the issues associated with the long-term preservation of data to support the scholarly knowledge cycle, such as the eBank UK project. Rapid developments in Internet access and mobile technology have significantly influenced the way researchers view connectivity, data standards, and the increasing importance and power of semantics and the Semantic Web. These technical advances interact strongly with the social dimension and have led to a reconsideration of the responsibilities of researchers for the quality of their research and for satisfying the requirements of modern stakeholders. Such obligations have given rise to discussions about Open Access and Open Data, creating a range of alternatives that are now technically feasible but need to be socially acceptable. Business plans are changing too, but in a strange contradiction, desire can run ahead of what is possible, sensible, and affordable, while lagging behind in imagination of what would be technically possible and potentially game-changing! Taking the chemical sciences as our example and focusing on the curation of research data, we explore from our perspective, ten years back and ten years forward, how far we have been able to re-imagine the data/information value pathway from bench to publication. We assess not only the major advances and changes that have been achieved, but also where we have been less successful than we might have hoped. We explore the directions for the future, based on what is clearly already possible and on what we can envisage becoming feasible in the near future.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.377", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 30]], "date-time": "2015-06-30T09:03:10Z", "timestamp": 1435654990000}, "page": "1-11", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Collection, Curation, Citation at Source: Publication@Source 10 Years On"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Jeremy", "family": "Frey", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Simon J.", "family": "Coles", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Colin", "family": "Bird", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Cerys", "family": "Willoughby", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 16]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.1/403", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.1/403", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:12:52Z", "timestamp": 1515021172000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 16]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.377", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T18:48:08Z", "timestamp": 1574707688464}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The Parliamentary Archives is responsible for preserving and providing access to the historical records of the UK Parliament, a collection of national, and indeed international, importance which encompasses a wide range of digital content, created and used in an ever changing environment.

It evolved from the GDF (Geophysical Data Facility), a SERC (Science and Engineering Research Council) facility, as a result of research council reform where NERC (Natural Environment Research Council) extended its remit to cover atmospheric data below 10km altitude. With that change the BADC took on data from many other atmospheric sources and started interacting with NERC research programmes. The BADC has now hit early adulthood. Prompted by this milestone, we examine in this paper whether the data centre is creaking at the seams or is looking forward to the prime of its life, gliding effortlessly into the future. Which parts of it are bullet proof and which parts are held together with double-sided sticky tape? Can we expect to see it in its present form in another twenty years\u2019 time? To answer these questions, we examine the interfaces, technology, processes and organisation used in the provision of data centre services by looking at three snapshots in time, 1994, 2004 and 2014, using metrics and reports from the time to compare and contrasts the services using BADC. The repository landscape has changed massively over this period and has moved the focus for technology and development as the broader community followed emerging trends, standards and ways of working. The incorporation of these new ideas has been both a blessing and a curse, providing the data centre staff with plenty of challenges and opportunities. We also discuss key data centre functions including: data discovery, data access, ingestion, data management planning, preservation plans, agreements/licences and data policy, storage and server technology, organisation and funding, and user management. We conclude that the data centre will probably still exist in some form in 2024 and that it will most likely still be reliant on a file system. However, the technology delivering this service will change and the host organisation and funding routes may vary.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.379", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 30]], "date-time": "2015-06-30T09:03:10Z", "timestamp": 1435654990000}, "page": "23-32", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Twenty Years of Data Management in the British Atmospheric Data Centre"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Sam", "family": "Pepler", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Sarah", "family": "Callaghan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 16]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.23/405", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.23/405", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:12:47Z", "timestamp": 1515021167000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 16]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.379", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T18:48:08Z", "timestamp": 1574707688491}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The focus of this paper is on the integration of audio resources with other content types in digital libraries.

Research took the form of an analysis of the current digital curation training landscape, focussing on doctoral study and supervision. This was followed by a survey (n=116) investigating attitudes towards importance, expertise, and responsibilities regarding digital curation. This research confirms that digital curation is considered to be very important within doctoral study but that doctoral supervisors and particularly students consider themselves to be largely unskilled at curation tasks. It provides a detailed picture of curation activity within doctoral study and identifies the areas of most concern. A detailed analysis demonstrates that most of the responsibility for curation is thought to lie with students and that institutions are perceived to have very low responsibility and that individuals tend to over-assign responsibility to themselves. Finally, the research identifies which types of support system for curation are most used and makes suggestions for ways in which students, supervisors, institutions, and others can effectively and efficiently address problematic areas and improve digital curation within doctoral study.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.328", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 2, 18]], "date-time": "2015-02-18T10:16:01Z", "timestamp": 1424254561000}, "page": "1-17", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Digital Curation and Doctoral Research"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Daisy", "family": "Abbott", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 1, 30]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.1.1/378", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.1.1/378", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:14:13Z", "timestamp": 1515021253000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 1, 30]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 2, 18]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.328", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 24]], "date-time": "2019-11-24T08:09:44Z", "timestamp": 1574582984740}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to better understand the factors that most influence where researchers deposit their data when they have a choice, we collected survey data from researchers who deposited phylogenetic data in either the TreeBASE or Dryad data repositories.

For metadata to be useful it first has to be present, but enforcing metadata generation is of no benefit if it is low quality, inconsistent, or irrelevant. Researchers need support. One strategy to encourage more effective metadata creation is to design user interfaces that invite users to add metadata by asking them questions. If we ask users specific questions about their experiments and other activities then we could capture more relevant or useful metadata, although there is a risk that asking the wrong questions may lead to loss of valuable metadata terms or the creation of irrelevant material. In this paper we report on a study to investigate how different questions could be used to generate metadata by eliciting information in three different conditions: free recall, changing perspective by thinking about search terms to help someone else, and providing cues by using a set of topic-based questions. We also investigate how responses varied with different information types. The results of the study show that different terms are created under the different conditions, as expected. The use of cues generates the highest numbers of terms and the most diverse range, including elements that are not captured in other conditions. However, important themes generated in other conditions are not produced because the cues to create them are missing. The study also generated a number of unexpected findings, including responses describing information that is not in the original material: personal opinions and experiences, and comments about the information text itself. These unexpected responses have both positive and negative consequences for the generation of metadata and the curation of scientific records. The results of studies using these techniques to capture metadata for chemistry experiments are also discussed.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.343", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 2, 18]], "date-time": "2015-02-18T10:16:01Z", "timestamp": 1424254561000}, "page": "18-47", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["User-Defined Metadata: Using Cues and Changing Perspectives"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Cerys", "family": "Willoughby", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Colin", "family": "Bird", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jeremy", "family": "Frey", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 1, 30]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.1.18/379", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.1.18/379", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:14:10Z", "timestamp": 1515021250000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 1, 30]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 2, 18]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.343", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 24]], "date-time": "2019-11-24T08:09:44Z", "timestamp": 1574582984770}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The Data Curation Profiles Toolkit (DCPT) emerged out of a Purdue University Libraries\u2019 2004 initiative to engage in multidisciplinary research.

The DCPT has been widely adopted and applied in various contexts but its usability as a tool has not been formally assessed. To address this need, we have conducted a survey of users of the DCPT. The survey included quantitative measures of potential influencing factors of using the DCPT and its perceived usability (its usefulness as a tool and its ease of use). Open-ended questions about users\u2019 experiences with the DCPT were also included to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the tool, as well as areas that could be improved. Factor analysis of the quantitative results and subsequent regression models revealed several underlying factors that affect the perceived usability of the DCPT. Responses to the open-ended questions revealed several themes of users\u2019 concerns: the amount of time required to use the DCPT, the structure and format of the DCPT, alignment of the DCPT with particular contexts, and the use of the DCPT to engage faculty and the library community. By correlating themes identified from the open-ended questions with the analysis of quantitative data, this paper provides the first empirical assessment of the DCPT that could help further improve the toolkit\u2019s usability based on user needs and expectations.

In 2009 this Data Seal of Approval (DSA) was transferred to an international body, the DSA Board, which has managed and further developed the guidelines and the peer review process ever since.The objectives of the DSA are to safeguard data, ensure high quality and guide reliable management of data for the future without requiring implementation of new standards, regulations or heavy investments. The DSA contains 16 guidelines for applying and verifying quality aspects concerning the creation, storage, use and reuse of digital data.Based on feedback from data archives that applied for a DSA and different case studies we have gained some insight into the benefits of DSA. Still, the impact of having the Seal is not easy to measure. Seal holders usually refer to qualitative benefits in the form of increased awareness of the value of their repositories to their communities, funders and publishers.Ten years down the line we can safely state that the Data Seal of Approval has proven its added value. If we try to look five years into the future, what can we expect? There are different developments: a growing interest in DSA among European research infrastructures, the collaboration between DSA and the ISCU World Data System under the umbrella of the RDA (Research Data Alliance) and the European Commission is showing a growing interest in certification services.The success of DSA also provides the challenge to further professionalize the DSA organization in the coming years, this to enable its community to continue to grow.

At least 13 such studies have been published in the UK and internationally. The aim of this paper is to analyse the results from the 2014 DAF survey at the University of Sheffield and to reflect on the comparability of this with previous published studies. 432 researchers responded to the survey representing 8% of the target population. Researchers at Sheffield collect multiple types of data and a significant number have accumulated very large amounts of data. Data was backed up on a diverse basis. Only 25% of respondents had a DMP. Eighteen months after its creation most respondents were still not aware of the local research data management policy. Fortunately, most respondents were favourable to the idea of training in many aspects of RDM. Researchers had generally had no experience of sharing data, but attitudes were positive, both in terms of a significant minority seeing a lack of data sharing as an obstacle to the progress of research and also desire to reuse the data of others and share their own with a broad group of researchers. Comparison of the Sheffield results with those of other institutions is difficult particularly because of the divergence of questions asked in the different studies.

Doing this enabled climate scientists to calculate a more accurate estimate of the recent changes in Earth\u2019s average land surface temperatures and to ascertain the extent to which climate change is anthropogenic. This paper surveys some of the approaches that have been taken to the integration of data schemata in general and examines some of the specific metadata features of the source surface temperature datasets that were harmonized by Berkeley Earth. The conclusion drawn from this analysis is that the original source data and the Berkeley Earth common format provides a promising training set on which to apply machine learning methods for replicating the human data integration process.

The library partnered with a researcher in the DPH to create a catalog of external datasets, which provided detailed metadata and access instructions. The catalog listed researchers at the medical center and the main campus with expertise in using these external datasets in order to facilitate research and cross-campus collaboration. Data description standards were reviewed to create a set of metadata to facilitate access to both externally generated datasets, as well as the internally generated datasets that would constitute the next phase of development of the catalog. Interviews with a range of investigators at the institution identified DPH researchers as most interested in data sharing, therefore targeted outreach to this group was undertaken. Initial outreach resulted in additional external datasets being described, new local experts volunteering, proposals for additional functionality, and interest from researchers in inclusion of their internal datasets in the catalog.

The implementation described here, \u201cCEDA-MOLES\u201d, also supports data management functions for the Centre for Environmental Data Archival, CEDA. The previous iteration of MOLES (MOLES2) saw active use over five years, being replaced by CEDA-MOLES in late 2014.

In this paper we review the problems encountered in MOLES2; how and why CEDA-MOLES was developed and engineered; the migration of information holdings from MOLES2 to CEDA-MOLES; and, finally, provide an early assessment of MOLES3 (as implemented in CEDA-MOLES) and its limitations.Key drivers for the MOLES3 development included the necessity for improved data provenance, for further structured information to support ISO19115 discovery metadata\u00a0 export (for EU INSPIRE compliance), and to provide appropriate fixed landing pages for Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) in the presence of evolving datasets. Key lessons learned included the importance of minimising information structure in free text fields, and the necessity to support as much agility in the information infrastructure as possible without compromising on maintainability both by those using the systems internally and externally (e.g. citing in to the information infrastructure), and those responsible for the systems themselves.

This paper reports on results from the Data Curation Education in Research Centers (DCERC) program aimed at developing a model for data curation education featuring field experiences in exemplar research centers. A strength of the DCERC model is its emphasis on facilitating mutual exchange of information among the DCERC program mentors and students. This model has evolved as a result of iterative and gradual refinements to the program model based upon information gathered from the formative evaluation. These refinements not only resulted in improved outcomes for the program participants but also, we believe, a more sustainable model for the program that leverages the knowledge base of the research scientists and students through peer-to-peer learning, rather than a traditional expert to trainee model. This paper describes formative evaluation findings that shaped the development of the DCERC program.

Exercises and assignments were designed to incorporate the student\u2019s own research data to create meaningful, authentic learning experiences. Formative and summative assessment was a critical component of the program, which included interviews with students six months after completion of the program to determine the extent to which the data competencies covered had taken root in students\u2019 research practices. The structure of the pilot program, its strengths and weakness, its impact on students, and lessons learned by the instructors are discussed.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.348", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3, 18]], "date-time": "2015-03-18T15:55:42Z", "timestamp": 1426694142000}, "page": "95-110", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 10, "title": ["Planting the Seeds for Data Literacy: Lessons Learned from a Student-Centered Education Program"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Jake", "family": "Carlson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Marianne", "family": "Stowell Bracke", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3, 18]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.1.95/383", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.1.95/383", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:13:58Z", "timestamp": 1515021238000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3, 18]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 2, 18]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.348", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 24]], "date-time": "2019-11-24T10:24:20Z", "timestamp": 1574591060206}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Research Data Management (RDM) provides a framework that supports researchers and their data throughout the course of their research and is increasingly regarded as one of the essential areas of responsible conduct of research.

Selecting, collecting, preserving and archiving digital assets, especially research data sets, are important steps in the research life cycle and can help expand the boundaries of research by allowing data to be reused. Creating research data sets often starts with selecting input data sources; in this age of new or \u201cbig\u201d data, that choice set keeps expanding, thereby making it more difficult and time consuming to discover and understand the vast data landscape when beginning an empirical research project.

The process of selecting, evaluating and presenting information about potential data inputs can help researchers more easily understand how certain data sets are used and better determine which data sources might be fit for their purposes.

Despite such a rate of loss, a majority of respondents expressed at least a moderate level of confidence that they would be able to make use of their digital objects in 25 years.

However, little is known about researchers\u2019 data management and sharing practices and concerns. The research reported in this paper seeks to address this by providing insight into the research data management and sharing practices of academics at ten universities in New South Wales, Australia. Empirical data was taken from a survey to which 760 academics responded, with 634 completing at least one section. Results showed that at the time of the survey there were a wide variety of research data in use, including analogue data, and that the challenges researchers faced in managing their data included finding safe and secure storage, particularly after project completion, but also during projects when data are used (and thus stored) on a wide variety of less-than-optimal temporary devices. Data sharing was not widely practiced and only a relatively small proportion of researchers had a research data management plan. Since the survey was completed much has changed: capacities and communities are being built around data management and sharing and policies, and guidelines are being constructed. Data storage and curation services are now more freely available. It will be interesting to observe how the findings of future studies compare with those reported here.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.329", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 7, 29]], "date-time": "2015-07-29T14:42:09Z", "timestamp": 1438180929000}, "page": "69-95", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 9, "title": ["Research Data Management Practices: A Snapshot in Time"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Mary Anne", "family": "Kennan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Lina", "family": "Markauskaite", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 7, 29]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.69/409", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.69/409", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:12:33Z", "timestamp": 1515021153000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 7, 29]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.329", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T20:19:27Z", "timestamp": 1574713167150}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>While stakeholders in scholarly communication generally agree on the importance of data citation, there is not consensus on where those citations should be placed within the publication \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly when the publication is citing original data.

This paper discusses requirements for preserving transactional data and the accompanying challenges facing the companies and institutions who aim to re-use these data for analysis or research. It presents a range of use cases \u2013 examples of transactional data \u2013 in order to describe the characteristics and difficulties of these \u2018big\u2019 data for long-term access. Based on the overarching trends discerned in these use cases, the paper will define the challenges facing the preservation of these data early in the curation lifecycle. It will point to potential solutions within current legal and ethical frameworks, but will focus on positioning the problem of re-using these data from a preservation perspective. In some contexts, these data could be fiscal in nature, deriving from business \u2018transactions\u2019. This paper, however, considers transactional data more broadly, addressing any data generated through interactions with a database system. Administrative data, for instance, is one important form of transactional data collected primarily for operational purposes, not for research. Examples of administrative data include information collected by government departments and other organisations when delivering a service (e.g. tax, health, or education) and can entail significant legal and ethical challenges for re-use. Transactional data, whether created by interactions between government database systems and citizens or by automatic sensors or machines, hold potential for future developments in academic research and consumer analytics. Re-use of reliable transactional data in research has the power to improve services and investments by organisations in many different sectors. Ultimately, however, these data will only lead to new discoveries and insights if they are effectively curated and preserved to ensure appropriate reproducibility.

The raw data came from multiple external sources, including government agencies, community repositories, and deployed field instruments and surveys. Each raw dataset goes through the processes of data QA/QC, data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. After integrating multiple datasets, new data products are obtained which are then used with the numerical model. The numerical model undergoes model verification, testing, calibration, and optimization. With a complex algorithm of computation, the model generates a structured output dataset, which is, after post-data analysis, presented as informative scientific figures and tables that allow interpretations and conclusions contributing to the science of coastal physical oceanography.

Since recognition of contribution has significant academic and professional impact for participants in scientific projects, it is important to integrate attribution and acknowledgement of scientific contributions into the research and data lifecycle. However, defining and clarifying contributions and the relationship of specific individuals and organizations can be challenging, especially when balancing the needs and interests of diverse partners. Designing an implementation method for attributing scientific contributions within complex projects that can allow ease of use and integration with existing documentation formats is another crucial consideration. To provide a versatile mechanism for organizing, documenting, and storing contributions to different types of scientific projects and their related products, an attribution and acknowledgement matrix and XML schema have been created as part of the Attribution and Acknowledgement Content Framework (AACF). Leveraging the taxonomies of contribution roles and types that have been developed and published previously, the authors consolidated 16 contribution types that could be considered and used when accrediting team member\u2019s contributions.

US law mandates that these data should be freely available to the public through \u2018public access\u2019, which is defined as fully discoverable and usable by the public. The U.S. government executive branch supported the public access requirements by issuing an Executive Directive titled \u2018Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research\u2019 that required federal agencies with annual research and development expenditures of more than $100 million to create public access plans by 22 August 2013. The directive applied to 19 federal agencies, some with multiple divisions. Additional direction for this initiative was provided by the Executive Order \u2018Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information\u2019  which was accompanied by a memorandum with specific guidelines for information management and instructions to find ways to reduce compliance costs through interagency cooperation. In late 2013, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) funded the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) to conduct a project to help IMLS and its constituents understand the implications of the US federal public access mandate and how needs and gaps in digital curation can best be addressed. Our project has three research components: (1) a structured content analysis of federal agency plans supporting public  access to data and publications, identifying both commonalities and differences among plans; (2) case studies (interviews and analysis of project deliverables) of seven projects previously funded by IMLS to identify lessons about skills, capabilities and institutional arrangements that can facilitate data curation activities; and (3) a gap analysis of continuing education and readiness assessment of the workforce. Research and cultural institutions urgently need to rethink the professional identities of those responsible for collecting, organizing, and preserving data for future use.

Data publication has emerged as a game-changing breakthrough in scholarly communication. Data form the outputs of research but also are a gateway to new hypotheses, enabling new scientific insights and driving innovation. And yet stakeholders across the scholarly ecosystem, including practitioners, institutions, and funders of scientific research are increasingly concerned about the lack of sharing and reuse of research data. Across disciplines and countries, researchers, funders, and publishers are pushing for a more effective research environment, minimizing the duplication of work and maximizing the interaction between researchers. Availability, discoverability, and reproducibility of research outputs are key factors to support data reuse and make possible this new environment of highly collaborative research. An interoperable e-infrastructure is imperative in order to develop new platforms and services for to data publication and reuse. DataCite has been working to establish and promote methods to locate, identify and share information about research data. Along with service development, DataCite supports and advocates for the standards behind persistent identifiers (in particular DOIs, Digital Object Identifiers) for data and other research outputs. Persistent identifiers allow different platforms to exchange information consistently and unambiguously and provide a reliable way to track citations and reuse. Because of this, data publication can become a reality from a technical standpoint, but the adoption of data publication and data citation as a practice by researchers is still in its early stages. Since 2009, DataCite has been developing a series of tools and services to foster the adoption of data publication and citation among the research community. Through the years, DataCite has worked in a close collaboration with interdisciplinary partners on these issues and we have gained insight into the development of data publication workflows.

The ``Play It Again'' project is conducting research into the largely unknown histories of 1980s game development in Australia and New Zealand, ensuring that local titles make it into national collections and are documented and preserved, enabling the public to once again play these games. Microcomputers from the 1980s made extensive use of compact audio cassettes to distribute software as an inexpensive alternative to the floppy disk technology available at the time. Media from this era are at risk of degradation and are rapidly approaching the end of their lifespan. As hardware platforms and peripheral devices become obsolete, access to the data for future scholars and other interested parties becomes more difficult. In this article, we present a case study, wherein we investigate the issues involved in making digital copies with a view to the long term preservation of these software artefacts. A video game title stored on standard compact cassette for Commodore's popular VIC-20 machine, ``Dinky Kong'' by Mark Sibley was recorded using both inexpensive amateur and professional playback equipment. The audio files obtained were processed using freely available software, alongside a customised decoder written in MATLAB and Perl. The resulting image files were found to be playable using an emulator. More importantly, the integrity of the data itself was verified, by making use of error detection features inbuilt to the Commodore tape format, which is described in detail. Issues influencing the quality of the recovered image files such as the bit rate of the digital recording are discussed. The phenomenon of audio dropout on magnetic tape is shown be of some concern, however there exist signal processing techniques to compensate for such errors. The end result of the imaging process was a file compatible with a popular Commodore VIC-20 emulator, the integrity of which was verified by using inbuilt checksums.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v11i2.386", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 12, 21]], "date-time": "2016-12-21T12:29:40Z", "timestamp": 1482323380000}, "page": "76-86", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Recovery of heritage software stored on magnetic tape for Commodore microcomputers"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "Denise", "family": "De Vries", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Craig", "family": "Harrington", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 4]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/11.2.76/453", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/11.2.76/453", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:11:32Z", "timestamp": 1515021092000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 4]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 4]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v11i2.386", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 26]], "date-time": "2019-11-26T16:11:19Z", "timestamp": 1574784679981}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper states 16 principles for the long term retention and preservation of digital geographic information.

There are many reasons why people wish to retain access to information, though the main drivers for archiving digital geographic information are meeting legislative requirements, the short and long term exploitation (re-use not only access) of archived data for analyzing social, environmental (e.g. global climate changes) and economic changes over time as well as efficiency savings in managing superseded datasets.\u00a0 This paper sets out the path and describes what needs to be done now to future-proof the investment government agencies around the world have made in creating digital Geographic Data.\u00a0</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v11i2.388", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 5, 21]], "date-time": "2017-05-21T22:14:47Z", "timestamp": 1495404887000}, "page": "156", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["GI+100: Long Term Preservation of Digital Geographic Information \u2014 16 Fundamental Principles Agreed by National Mapping Agencies and State Archives"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "Carsten", "family": "R\u00f6nsdorf", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Paul", "family": "Mason", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jonathan", "family": "Holmes", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Urs", "family": "Gerber", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Andr\u00e9", "family": "Streilein", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Margu\u00e9rite", "family": "Bos", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Arif", "family": "Shaon", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Kai", "family": "Naumann", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Michael", "family": "Kirstein", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "G\u00f6ran", "family": "Samuelsson", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Marja", "family": "Rantala", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Sidsel", "family": "Kvarteig", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Lynne", "family": "Adams", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jenny", "family": "Svennewall", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Wolfgang", "family": "St\u00f6\u00dfel", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 5, 21]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/viewFile/388/461", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 4]], "date-time": "2017-07-04T08:36:42Z", "timestamp": 1499157402000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 5, 21]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 12, 2]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v11i2.388", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 26]], "date-time": "2019-11-26T19:30:25Z", "timestamp": 1574796625942}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the results of a research data assessment and landscape study in the institutional context of Virginia Tech to determine the data sharing and reuse practices of academic faculty researchers.

Data sharing efforts in particular are nascent, disunited and incomplete. We investigate the development of data products tailored for diverse communities with differing knowledge bases. We explore not the technical aspects of how, why, or where data are made available, but rather the socio-scientific aspects influencing what data products are created and made available for use. These products differ from compact data summaries often published in journals. We report on development by a national data center of two data collections describing the changing polar environment. One collection characterizes sea ice products derived from satellite remote sensing data and development unfolds over three decades. The second collection characterizes the Greenland Ice Sheet melt where development of an initial collection of data products over a period of several months was informed by insights gained from earlier experience. In documenting the generation of these two collections, a data product development cycle supported by a data product team is identified as key to mobilizing scientific knowledge. The collections reveal a co-evolution of data products and designated communities where community interest may be triggered by events such as environmental disturbance and new modes of communication. These examples of data product development in practice illustrate knowledge mobilization in the earth sciences; the collections create a bridge between data producers and a growing number of audiences interested in making evidence-based decisions. \u00a0</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.346", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 5, 14]], "date-time": "2016-05-14T21:53:31Z", "timestamp": 1463262811000}, "page": "110-135", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["Scientific Knowledge Mobilization: Co-evolution of Data Products and Designated Communities"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Karen S.", "family": "Baker", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ruth E.", "family": "Duerr", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Mark A.", "family": "Parsons", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 5, 12]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.110/411", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.110/411", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:12:26Z", "timestamp": 1515021146000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 5, 12]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.346", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 26]], "date-time": "2019-11-26T21:31:10Z", "timestamp": 1574803870494}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>As science becomes more data-intensive and collaborative, researchers increasingly use larger and more complex data to answer research questions. The capacity of storage infrastructure, the increased sophistication and deployment of sensors, the ubiquitous availability of computer clusters, the development of new analysis techniques, and larger collaborations allow researchers to address grand societal challenges in a way that is unprecedented. In parallel, research data repositories have been built to host research data in response to the requirements of sponsors that research data be publicly available. Libraries are re-inventing themselves to respond to a growing demand to manage, store, curate and preserve the data produced in the course of publicly funded research. As librarians and data managers are developing the tools and knowledge they need to meet these new expectations, they inevitably encounter conversations around Big Data. This paper explores definitions of Big Data that have coalesced in the last decade around four commonly mentioned characteristics: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. We highlight the issues associated with each characteristic, particularly their impact on data management and curation. We use the methodological framework of the data life cycle model, assessing two models developed in the context of Big Data projects and find them lacking. We propose a Big Data life cycle model that includes activities focused on Big Data and more closely integrates curation with the research life cycle. These activities include planning, acquiring, preparing, analyzing, preserving, and discovering, with describing the data and assuring quality being an integral part of each activity. We discuss the relationship between institutional data curation repositories and new long-term data resources associated with high performance computing centers, and reproducibility in computational science. We apply this model by mapping the four characteristics of Big Data outlined above to each of the activities in the model. This mapping produces a set of questions that practitioners should be asking in a Big Data project</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.342", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 5, 27]], "date-time": "2016-05-27T14:11:22Z", "timestamp": 1464358282000}, "page": "176-192", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["Revisiting the Data Lifecycle with Big Data Curation"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Line", "family": "Pouchard", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 5, 27]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.176/415", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/10.2.176/415", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:12:17Z", "timestamp": 1515021137000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 5, 27]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2015, 6, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.342", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T06:31:21Z", "timestamp": 1574836281011}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>To address the complexities researchers face during publication, and the potential community-wide benefits of wider adoption of clear data policies, the publisher Springer Nature has developed a standardised, common framework for the research data policies of all its journals.

The group then consulted with approximately 30 editors, covering all research disciplines within the organisation. The group also consulted with academic editors, librarians and funders, which informed development of the framework and the creation of supporting resources. Four types of data policy were defined in recognition that some journals and research communities are more ready than others to adopt strong data policies. As of January 2017 more than 700 journals have adopted a standard policy and this number is growing weekly. To potentially enable standardisation and harmonisation of data policy across funders, institutions, repositories, societies and other publishers, the policy framework was made available under a Creative Commons license.

Data documentation with robust metadata is one of a number of steps in effective data publication. Data publication is the process of making digital research objects \u2018FAIR\u2019, i.e. findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable; attributes increasingly expected by research communities, funders and society. Research data publishing workflows are the means to that end. Currently, however, much published research data remains inconsistently and inadequately documented by researchers. Documentation of data closer in time to data collection would help mitigate the high cost that repositories associate with the ingest process. More effective data publication and sharing should in principle result from early interactions between researchers and their selected data repository. This paper describes a short study undertaken by members of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) and World Data System (WDS) working group on Publishing Data Workflows. We present a collection of recent examples of data publication workflows that connect data repositories and publishing platforms with research activity \u2018upstream\u2019 of the ingest process. We re-articulate previous recommendations of the working group, to account for the varied upstream service components and platforms that support the flow of contextual and provenance information downstream. These workflows should be open and loosely coupled to support interoperability, including with preservation and publication environments.

Workflows have the advantage that not only can they be automated and used to process data repeatedly, but they can also be reused \u2013 in part or whole \u2013 enabling them to be evolved for use in new experiments. A number of studies have investigated strategies for storing and sharing workflows for the benefit of reuse. These have revealed that simply storing workflows in repositories without additional context does not enable workflows to be successfully reused. These studies have investigated what additional resources are needed to facilitate users of workflows and in particular to add provenance traces and to make workflows and their resources machine-readable. These additions also include adding metadata for curation, annotations for comprehension, and including data sets to provide additional context to the workflow. Ultimately though, these mechanisms still rely on researchers having access to the software to view and run the workflows. We argue that there are situations where researchers may want to understand a workflow that goes beyond what provenance traces provide and without having to run the workflow directly; there are many situations in which it can be difficult or impossible to run the original workflow. To that end, we have investigated the creation of an interactive workflow visualization that captures the flow chart element of the workflow with additional context including annotations, descriptions, parameters, metadata and input, intermediate, and results data that can be added to the record of a workflow experiment to enhance both curation and add value to enable reuse. We have created interactive workflow visualisations for the popular workflow creation tool KNIME, which does not provide users with an in-built function to extract provenance information that can otherwise only be viewed through the tool itself. Making use of the strengths of KNIME for adding documentation and user-defined metadata we can extract and create a visualisation and curation package that encourages and enhances curation@source, facilitating effective communication, collaboration, and reuse of workflows.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v12i1.532", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 9, 16]], "date-time": "2017-09-16T21:16:52Z", "timestamp": 1505596612000}, "page": "72-87", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Documentation and Visualisation of Workflows for Effective Communication, Collaboration and Publication @ Source"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "Cerys", "family": "Willoughby", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jeremy G.", "family": "Frey", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 9, 16]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/12.1.72/468", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/12.1.72/468", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:10:44Z", "timestamp": 1515021044000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 9, 16]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 9, 16]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v12i1.532", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T06:31:22Z", "timestamp": 1574836282660}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Data management plans are free-form text documents describing the data used and produced in scientific experiments.

Developing the skills to plan and perform data management tasks is important for individuals and institutions. Teaching data literacy skills may also help to mitigate the impact of data deluge and other effects of being overexposed to and overwhelmed by data.&#x0D;\nThe process of learning how to manage data effectively for the entire research data lifecycle can be complex. There are often multiple stages involved within a lifecycle for managing data, and each stage may require specific knowledge, expertise, and resources. Additionally, although a range of organizations offers data management education and training resources, it can often be difficult to assess how effective the resources are for educating users to meet their data management requirements.&#x0D;\nIn the case of Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE), DataONE\u2019s extensive collaboration with individuals and organizations has informed the development of multiple educational resources. Through these interactions, DataONE understands that the process of creating and maintaining educational materials that remain responsive to community needs is reliant on careful evaluations. Therefore, the impetus for a comprehensive, customizable Education EVAluation instrument (EEVA) is grounded in the need for tools to assess and improve current and future training and educational resources for research data management.&#x0D;\nIn this paper, the authors outline and provide context for the background and motivations that led to creating EEVA for evaluating the effectiveness of data management educational resources.

The CRN-PEI Guiding Principles outline the key legal and ethical obligations of archiving this legacy evaluation data, and act as moral compass to steer our progress through these uncharted waters. The CRN-PEI Protocols define the standards for how data included in the Initiative is prepared for deposition in the public data archives, so they are easily located, interpretable and comparable in the long term.

Those who developed this standard have articulated seven main benefits of acquiring DSAs: 1) stakeholder confidence, 2) improvements in communication, 3) improvement in processes, 4) transparency, 5) differentiation from others, 6) awareness raising about digital preservation, and 7) less labor- and time-intensive. Little research has focused on if and how those who have acquired DSAs actually perceive these benefits. Consequently, this study examines the benefits of acquiring DSAs from the point of view of those who have them. In a series of 15 semi-structured interviews with representatives from 16 different organizations, participants described the benefits of having DSAs in their own words. Our findings suggest that participants experience all of the seven benefits that those who developed the standard promised. Additionally, our findings reflect the greater importance of some of those benefits compared to others. For example, participants mentioned the benefits of stakeholder confidence, transparency, improvement in processes and awareness raising about digital preservation more frequently than they discussed less labor- and time-intensive (e.g. it being less labor- and time-intensive to acquire DSAs than becoming certified by other standards), improvements in communication, and differentiation from others. Participants also mentioned two additional benefits of acquiring DSAs that are not explicitly listed on the DSA website that were very important to them: 1) the impact of acquiring the DSA on documentation of their workflows, and 2) assurance that they were following best practice. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v12i1.481", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:09:45Z", "timestamp": 1515020985000}, "page": "130-151", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["The Perceived Value of Acquiring Data Seals of Approval"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "12", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2304-6303", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Devan Ray", "family": "Donaldson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5654-2392", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Ingrid", "family": "Dillo", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8595-5134", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Robert", "family": "Downs", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Sarah", "family": "Ramdeen", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 29]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/481/476", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/481/476", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 5]], "date-time": "2018-01-05T12:04:32Z", "timestamp": 1515153872000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 29]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 9, 16]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v12i1.481", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 1]], "date-time": "2019-12-01T17:02:20Z", "timestamp": 1575219740729}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "license": [{"URL": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "start": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 30]], "date-time": "2017-12-30T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1514592000000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Computers and computation have become essential to scientific activity and significant amounts of data are now captured digitally or even \u201cborn digital\u201d. Consequently, there is more and more incentive to capture the full experiment records using digital tools, such as Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELNs), to enable the effective linking and publication of experiment design and methods with the digital data that is generated as a result. Inclusion of metadata for experiment records helps with providing access, effective curation, improving search, and providing context, and further enables effective sharing, collaboration, and reuse.&#x0D;\nRegrettably, just providing researchers with the facility to add metadata to their experiment records does not mean that they will make use of it, or if they do, that the metadata they add will be relevant and useful. Our research has clearly indicated that researchers need support and tools to encourage them to create effective metadata. Tools, such as ELNs, provide an opportunity to encourage researchers to curate their records during their creation, but can also add extra value, by making use of the metadata that is generated to provide capabilities for research management and Open Science that extend far beyond what is possible with paper notebooks.&#x0D;\nThe Southampton Chemical Information group, has, for over fifteen years, investigated the use of the Web and other tools for the collection, curation, dissemination, reuse, and exploitation of scientific data and information. As part of this activity we have developed a number of ELNs, but a primary concern has been how best to ensure that the future development of such tools is both usable and useful to researchers and their communities, with a focus on curation at source. In this paper, we describe a number of user research and user studies to help answer questions about how our community makes use of tools and how we can better facilitate the capture and curation of experiment records and the related resources.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v12i2.514", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:09:45Z", "timestamp": 1515020985000}, "page": "1-25", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Encouraging and Facilitating Laboratory Scientists to Curate at Source"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "12", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1721-9212", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Cerys", "family": "Willoughby", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0842-4302", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Frey", "family": "Jeremy", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 30]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/514/478", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/514/478", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 5]], "date-time": "2018-01-05T12:04:26Z", "timestamp": 1515153866000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 30]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 31]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v12i2.514", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 1]], "date-time": "2019-12-01T17:02:20Z", "timestamp": 1575219740758}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "license": [{"URL": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "start": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 30]], "date-time": "2017-12-30T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1514592000000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The economic and societal benefits of making research data available for reuse and verification are now widely understood and accepted.

Because of these issues, standards in place for archiving digital information are not always suitable for the preservation of these works. The impact on the organisation and the descriptions of such archives need to be conceptualised in order to provide these technological components with readability, authenticity and intelligibility. While previous projects emphasized readability and authenticity, less effort has been dedicated to addressing intelligibility issues.The research into the specification of significant properties and its extension, namely significant knowledge, offers some grounds for reflecting on this question. Furthermore, the relevance of taking into account the creative process involved in the production of technological components offers an opportunity to redefine the status of technological agents in the performative aspect of digital records.

Despite the majority of journal publishers\u2019 acceptance of author self-archiving practices, and the minimal time commitment required by authors to successfully self-archive their work in disciplinary or institutional repositories, the majority of authors still by and large avoid participation. The paper reviews the strategies and arguments used for increasing author participation in open access, including the role of open access mandates. We recommend a service-oriented approach towards increasing participation in open access, rather than rhetoric that speculates on the benefits that open access will have on text/data mining innovation. In advocating for open access participation, we recommend focusing on its most universal and tangible purpose: increasing public open (gratis) access to the published results of publicly funded research.  Researchers require strong institutional support to understand the copyright climate of open access self-archiving, user-friendly interfaces and useful metrics, such as repository usage statistics. We recommend that mandates and well-crafted and responsive author support services at universities will ultimately be required to ensure the growth of open access. We describe the mediated deposit service that was developed to support author self-archiving in Spectrum: Concordia University Research Repository. By comparing the number of deposits of non-thesis materials (e.g. articles and conference presentations) that were accomplished through the staff-mediated deposit service to the number of deposits that were author-initiated, we demonstrate the relative significance of this service to the growth of the repository.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v8i1.238", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 6, 20]], "date-time": "2013-06-20T10:26:05Z", "timestamp": 1371723965000}, "page": "84-106", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 5, "title": ["The Critical Role of Institutional Services in Open Access Advocacy"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Tomasz", "family": "Neugebauer", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Annie", "family": "Murray", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 6, 14]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8.1.84/315", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8.1.84/315", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:18:12Z", "timestamp": 1515021492000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 6, 14]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 6, 20]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v8i1.238", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 1]], "date-time": "2019-12-01T22:09:51Z", "timestamp": 1575238191353}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>To preserve digital information it is vital that the format of that information can be identified, in-perpetuity.

The emergence of cloud offerings re-centralizes services, and end users interact with them remotely through standardized (web-)client applications on their various devices. This offers the chance to use partially the same concepts and methods to access obsolete computer environments and allows for more sustainable business processes. In order to provide a large variety of user-friendly remote emulation services, especially in combination with authentic performance and user experience, a distributed system model and architecture is required, suitable to run as a cloud service, allowing for the specialization both of memory institutions and third party service providers.The shift of the usually non-trivial task of the emulation of obsolete software environments from the end user to specialized providers can help to simplify digital preservation and access strategies. Besides offering their users better access to their holdings, libraries and archives may gain new business opportunities to offer services to a third party, such as businesses requiring authentic reproduction of digital objects and processes for legal reasons. This paper discusses cloud concepts as the next logical step for accessing original digital material. Emulation-as-a-Service (EaaS) fills the gap between the successful demonstration of emulation strategies as a long term access strategy and it\u2019s perceived availability and usability. EaaS can build upon the ground of research and prototypical implementations of previous projects, and reuse well established remote access technology.In this article we develop requirements and a system model, suitable for a distributed environment.

In 2016, new training on spreadsheet curation was introduced at the University of Sydney to address a gap between practical software skills training and generalised research data management training. The approach to spreadsheet curation behind the training was defined and the training's distinction from other spreadsheet curation training offering described.\\parThe uptake of and feedback on the training were evaluated. Training attendance was analysed by discipline and by role. Quantitative and qualitative feedback were analysed and discussed. Feedback revealed that many attendees had been expecting and desired practical spreadsheet software skills training. Issues relating to whether or not practical skills training should and can be integrated with curation training were discussed. While attendees were found to be predominantly from science disciplines, qualitative feedback suggests that humanities attendees have specific needs in relation to managing data with spreadsheets that are currently not being met. Feedback also suggested that some attendees would prefer the curation training to be delivered as a longer, more in depth, hands on workshop.\\parThe impact of the training was measured using data collected from the University's Research Data Management Planning (RDMP) tool and the Sydney eScholarship Repository. RDMP descriptions of spreadsheet data and records of tabular datasets published in the repository were analysed and assessed for quality and for accompanying data documentation. No significant improvements in data documentation or quality were found, however it is likely too soon after the launch of the training program to have seen much in the way of impact.\\parIdentified next steps include clarifying the marketing material promoting to the training to better communicate the curation focus, investigating the needs of humanities researchers working with qualitative data in spreadsheets, and incorporating new material into the training in order to address those needs. Integrating curation training with practical skills training and modifying the training to be more hands on are changes that may be considered in future, but will not be implemented at this stage.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v12i2.507", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 4, 1]], "date-time": "2018-04-01T22:35:40Z", "timestamp": 1522622140000}, "page": "116-124", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Researcher training in spreadsheet curation"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "Gene Lyddon", "family": "Melzack", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 4, 1]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/507/487", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/507/487", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 4, 1]], "date-time": "2018-04-01T22:35:43Z", "timestamp": 1522622143000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 4, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 31]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v12i2.507", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 2]], "date-time": "2019-12-02T08:03:16Z", "timestamp": 1575273796965}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2018, 4, 2]], "date-time": "2018-04-02T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1522627200000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "funder": [{"DOI": "10.13039/501100000269", "name": "Economic and Social Research Council", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "award": ["RES-620-28-0002"]}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we provide a case study of the creation of the DCAL Research Data Archive at University College London.

A project or experiment may run for years. Software and hardware may change as can the operating system. Containerisation is a technology that is used in a variety of companies, such as Google, Amazon and IBM, and scientific projects to rapidly deploy a set of services repeatably. Using Dockerfiles to ensure that a container is built repeatably, to allow conformance and easy updating when changes take place are becoming common within projects. Its seen as part of sustainable software development. Containerisation technology occupies a dual space: it is both a repository of software and software itself. In considering Docker in this fashion, we should verify that the Dockerfile can be reproduced. Using a subset of the Dockerfile specification, a domain specific language is created to ensure that Docker files can be reused at a later stage to recreate the original environment. We provide a simple framework to address the question of the preservation of containers and its environment. We present experiments on an existing Dockerfile and conclude with a discussion of future work. Taking our work, a pipeline was implemented to check that a defined Dockerfile conforms to our desired model, extracts the Docker and operating system details. This will help the reproducibility of results by creating the machine environment and package versions. It also helps development and testing through ensuring that the system is repeatably built and that any changes in the software environment can be equally shared in the Dockerfile. This work supports not only the citation process it also the open scientific one by providing environmental details of the work. As a part of the pipeline to create the container, we capture the processes used and put them into the W3C PROV ontology. This provides the potential for providing it with a persistent identifier and traceability of the processes used to preserve the metadata. Our future work will look at the question of linking this output to a workflow ontology to preserve the complete workflow with the commands and parameters to be given to the containers. We see this provenance within the build process useful to provide a complete overview of the workflow.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v12i2.509", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 4, 2]], "date-time": "2018-04-02T22:36:25Z", "timestamp": 1522708585000}, "page": "125-135", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["A Framework for the Preservation of a Docker Container"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "12", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5805-1367", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Iain", "family": "Emsley", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9074-3016", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "David", "family": "De Roure", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 4, 2]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/509/488", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/509/488", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 4, 2]], "date-time": "2018-04-02T22:36:42Z", "timestamp": 1522708602000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 4, 2]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 31]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v12i2.509", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 2]], "date-time": "2019-12-02T10:27:11Z", "timestamp": 1575282431382}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]], "date-time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 0}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This practice paper describes an ongoing research project to test the effectiveness and relevance of the FAIR Data Principles.

For all 2016 journals with a required data deposit policy, publication information (2009-2015) for the University of Toronto was pulled from Scopus and departmental affiliation was determined for each article. The results showed that the number of high-impact journals in the physical and applied sciences requiring data deposit is growing. In 2014, 71.2% of journals had no policy, 14.7% had a recommended policy, and 13.9% had a required policy (n=836). In contrast, in 2016, there were 58.5% with no policy, 19.4% with a recommended policy, and 22.0% with a required policy (n=880). It was also evident that U of T chemistry researchers are by far the most heavily affected by these journal data deposit requirements, having published 543 publications, representing 32.7% of all publications in the titles requiring data deposit in 2016.

We carried out qualitative interviews with researchers as well as institutional representatives to identify drivers and barriers, and to explore synergies and discords of both towards RDM. We mapped these to a data lifecycle model and found that the contradictions occur at early stages in the lifecycle of data and the synergies occur at the later stages. This means that for future successful RDM, the points of discord at the start of the data lifecycle must be overcome. Finally, we conclude by proposing key recommendations that could help institutions when addressing both researcher and institutional RDM needs.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.499", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]], "date-time": "2018-12-28T14:43:50Z", "timestamp": 1546008230000}, "page": "73-90", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Research Data Management Practices: Synergies and Discords between Researchers and Institutions"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "13", "author": [{"given": "Sally", "family": "Vanden-Hehir", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Helena", "family": "Cousijn", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Hesham", "family": "Attalla", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 23]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/499/516", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/499/516", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]], "date-time": "2018-12-28T14:44:01Z", "timestamp": 1546008241000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 23]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.499", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 3]], "date-time": "2019-12-03T12:11:53Z", "timestamp": 1575375113737}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2018-12-23T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1545523200000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Since its creation nearly a decade ago, the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) Curation Lifecycle Model has become the quintessential framework for understanding digital curation.

These may include support for data management planning, best practices (e.g., organization, support, and storage), archiving, sharing, and publication. However, these data-focused services may under-emphasize the importance of the software that is created to analyse said data. This is problematic for several reasons. First, because software is an integral part of research across all disciplines, it undermines the ability of said research to be understood, verified, and reused by others (and perhaps even the researcher themselves). Second, it may result in less visibility and credit for those involved in creating the software. A third reason is related to stewardship: if there is no clear process for how, when, and where the software associated with research can be accessed and who will be responsible for maintaining such access, important details of the research may be lost over time.&#x0D;\nThis article presents the process by which the RDM services unit of a large research university addressed the lack of emphasis on software and source code in their existing service offerings. The greatest challenges were related to the need to incorporate software into existing data-oriented service workflows while minimizing additional resources required, and the nascent state of software curation and archiving in a data management context. The problem was addressed from four directions: building an understanding of software curation and preservation from various viewpoints (e.g., video games, software engineering), building a conceptual model of software preservation to guide service decisions, implementing software-related services, and documenting and evaluating the work to build expertise and establish a standard service level.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.608", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]], "date-time": "2018-12-28T14:43:50Z", "timestamp": 1546008230000}, "page": "235-247", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Incorporating Software Curation into Research Data Management Services: Lessons Learned"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "13", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6262-3260", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Fernando", "family": "Rios", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/608/529", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/608/529", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]], "date-time": "2018-12-28T14:43:52Z", "timestamp": 1546008232000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.608", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 3]], "date-time": "2019-12-03T12:11:54Z", "timestamp": 1575375114331}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 27]], "date-time": "2018-12-27T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1545868800000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the biggest challenges for multidisciplinary research institutions which provide data management support to researchers is addressing disciplinary differences (Akers and Doty,2013).

The underlying technology is based on the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS), which implements a policy-based approach to distributed data management. By differentiating between different phases of the data life cycle based upon the evolution of data management policies, the infrastructure can be tuned to support data publication, data sharing, data analysis and data preservation. It is possible to build generic data management infrastructure that can evolve to meet the management requirements of each user community, federal agency and academic research project. In order to manage the properties of the data collections, we have developed and integrated scalable digital library services that support the discovery of, and access to, material organized as a collection.The integrated preservation environment prototype implements specific technologies that are capable of managing a wide range of preservation requirements, from parsing of legacy document formats, to enforcement of preservation policies, to validation of trustworthiness assessment criteria. Each capability has been demonstrated and is instantiated in multiple instances, both in the United States as part of the DataNet Federation Consortium (DFC) and through multiple European projects, primarily the FP7 SHAMAN project.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v8i2.268", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2013-11-21T16:10:51Z", "timestamp": 1385050251000}, "page": "47-67", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["Evolving Persistent Archives and Digital Library Systems: Integrating iRods, Cheshire3 and Multivalent"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Reagan", "family": "Moore", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Arcot", "family": "Rajasekar", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Paul", "family": "Watry", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Fabio", "family": "Corubolo", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "John", "family": "Harrison", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jerome", "family": "Fuselier", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 19]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8.2.47/334", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8.2.47/334", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:17:12Z", "timestamp": 1515021432000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 19]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 21]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v8i2.268", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 3]], "date-time": "2019-12-03T19:53:15Z", "timestamp": 1575402795802}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Research data is increasingly perceived as a valuable resource and, with appropriate curation and preservation, it has much to offer learning, teaching, research, knowledge transfer and consultancy activities in the visual arts.

Work has now begun on integrating these various elements into a unified infrastructure for the whole university, under the aegis of the Data Management Roll-out at Oxford (Damaro) Project.This paper will explain the process and motivation behind the project, and describes our vision for the future. It will also introduce the new tools and processes created by the university to tie the individual RDM components together. Chief among these is the \u2018DataFinder\u2019 \u2013 a hierarchically-structured metadata cataloguing system which will enable researchers to search for and locate research datasets hosted in a variety of different datastores from institutional repositories, through Web 2 services, to filing cabinets standing in department offices. DataFinder will be able to pull and associate research metadata from research information databases and data management plans, and is intended to be CERIF compatible. DataFinder is being designed so that it can be deployed at different levels within different contexts, with higher-level instances harvesting information from lower-level instances enabling, for example, an academic department to deploy one instance of DataFinder, which can then be harvested by another at an institutional level, which can then in turn be harvested by another at a national level.The paper will also consider the requirements of embedding tools and training within an institution and address the difficulties of ensuring the sustainability of an RDM infrastructure at a time when funding for such endeavours is limited. Our research shows that researchers (and indeed departments) are at present not exposed to the true costs of their (often suboptimal) data management solutions, whereas when data management services are centrally provided the full costs are visible and off-putting. There is, therefore, the need to sell the benefits of centrally-provided infrastructure to researchers. Furthermore, there is a distinction between training and services that can be most effectively provided at the institutional level, and those which need to be provided at the divisional or departmental level in order to be relevant and applicable to researchers. This is being addressed in principle by Oxford\u2019s research data management policy, and in practice by the planning and piloting aspects of the Damaro Project.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v8i2.287", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2013-11-21T16:10:51Z", "timestamp": 1385050251000}, "page": "235-246", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["Towards a Unified University Infrastructure: The Data Management Roll-Out at the University of Oxford"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "James A.

The fact that research repositories will record data differently means that assumptions must be made as how to transform of this data. Records of provenance that document how this process has taken place will enable users of the data warehouse to utilise the data appropriately and ensure that future data added from another source is transformed using comparable assumptions. For a provenance-based approach to be reusable and supportable with software tools, the provenance records must use a well-defined model of the transformation process.

An integral part of such an infrastructure constitutes the resources (data and tools) which researchers in the various disciplines employ. Whether the infrastructure will be successful in supporting the needs of the research communities it intends to cater for depends on a number of factors. One factor is that resources that are or could be relevant to the wider research community are made visible through this infrastructure and, to the greatest extent possible, accessible and usable. In practice, the durable availability of resources is often not properly regulated within research projects.CLARIN-NL is directed at creating an interoperable language resources infrastructure for the humanities in the Netherlands. The Data Curation Service was established in order to salvage language resources in this field that are threatened to be lost. In the CLARIN context, a great deal of attention is given to standards, formats and intellectual property rights. Consequently, the Data Curation Service (DCS) has a role as mediator in bringing researchers in the field of humanities and existing data centres closer together.This article consists of two parts: the first part provides the background to the work of the DCS while the second part illustrates the work of the DCS by describing the actual curation of a collection of language learner data.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v8i2.278", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2013-11-21T16:10:51Z", "timestamp": 1385050251000}, "page": "134-145", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["The CLARIN-NL Data Curation Service: Bringing Data to the Foreground"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Nelleke", "family": "Oostdijk", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Henk", "family": "Van den Heuvel", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Maaske", "family": "Treurniet", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 19]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8.2.134/323", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8.2.134/323", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:16:55Z", "timestamp": 1515021415000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 19]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 21]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v8i2.278", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 3]], "date-time": "2019-12-03T20:00:46Z", "timestamp": 1575403246818}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>In the spring of 2011, the UK\u2019s Digital Curation Centre (DCC) commenced a programme of outreach designed to assist individual universities in their development of aptitude for managing research data.

The University of Bath has a strong applied science and engineering research focus and, as such, the EPSRC is a major funder of the university\u2019s research. In this paper, the Jisc-funded Research360 project shares its experience in developing the infrastructure required to enable a research-intensive institution to achieve full compliance with a particular funder\u2019s policy, in such a way as to support the varied data management needs of both the University of Bath and its external stakeholders. A key feature of the Research360 project was to ensure that after the project\u2019s completion in summer 2013 the newly developed data management infrastructure would be maintained up to and beyond the EPSRC\u2019s 2015 deadline. Central to these plans was the \u2018University of Bath Roadmap for EPSRC\u2019, which was identified as an exemplar response by the EPSRC. This paper explores how a roadmap designed to meet a single funder\u2019s requirements can be compatible with the strategic goals of an institution. Also discussed is how the project worked with Charles Beagrie Ltd to develop a supporting business case, thus ensuring implementation of these long-term objectives. This paper describes how two new data management roles, the Institutional Data Scientist and Technical Data Coordinator, have contributed to delivery of the Research360 project and the importance of these new types of cross-institutional roles for embedding a new data management infrastructure within an institution. Finally, the experience of developing a new institutional data policy is shared. This policy represents a particular example of the need to reconcile a funder\u2019s expectations with the needs of individual researchers and their collaborators.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v8i2.280", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2013-11-21T16:10:51Z", "timestamp": 1385050251000}, "page": "157-171", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Meeting the Data Management Compliance Challenge: Funder Expectations and Institutional Reality"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Catherine", "family": "Pink", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 19]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8.2.157/325", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/8.2.157/325", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:16:48Z", "timestamp": 1515021408000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 19]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 21]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v8i2.280", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 3]], "date-time": "2019-12-03T20:00:46Z", "timestamp": 1575403246826}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper discusses work to implement the University of Edinburgh Research Data Management (RDM) policy by developing the services needed to support researchers and fulfil obligations within a changing national and international setting.

In so doing, this study suggests how agile projects like the AWAHDC can be core components in digital curation policies and their implementation.\u00a0</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.554", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 14]], "date-time": "2019-04-14T00:08:16Z", "timestamp": 1555200496000}, "page": "271-285", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Getting to Beta"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "13", "author": [{"given": "Kathryn", "family": "Gucer", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Kristina", "family": "Adams", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Chuck", "family": "Schoppet", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ricardo", "family": "Punzalan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 13]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/554/531", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/554/531", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 14]], "date-time": "2019-04-14T00:08:17Z", "timestamp": 1555200497000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 13]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.554", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T06:25:29Z", "timestamp": 1575440729111}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 19]], "date-time": "2019-04-19T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1555632000000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes our recent and ongoing efforts to enhance the curation of scientific workflows to improve reproducibility and reusability of biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance (bioNMR) data.

In contrast to specialized data repositories, these services will accept data from all kind of research disciplines. To ensure FAIR data principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016), preservation plans are required, because ensuring accessibility, interoperability and re-usability even for a minimum ten year data redemption period can become a major challenge. Both for longevity and re-usability, file formats matter. In order to ensure access to data, the data\u2019s encoding, i.e. their technical and structural representation in form of file formats, needs to be understood. Hence, due to a fast technical lifecycle, interoperability, re-use and in some cases even accessibility depends on the data\u2019s format and our future ability to parse or render these. &#x0D;\nThis leads to several practical questions regarding quality assurance, potential access options and necessary future preservation steps.

To address the problem of big data interfaces, we provide data representations that highlight the structure of the datasets and the possibility to browse their components in relation to provenance.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.661", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 30]], "date-time": "2019-04-30T18:00:13Z", "timestamp": 1556647213000}, "page": "306-317", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Designing and Building Interactive Curation Pipelines for Natural Hazards in Engineering Data"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "13", "author": [{"given": "Maria", "family": "Esteva", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Craig", "family": "Jansen", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Josue Balandrano", "family": "Coronel", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/661/534", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/661/534", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 30]], "date-time": "2019-04-30T18:00:13Z", "timestamp": 1556647213000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.661", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T08:56:13Z", "timestamp": 1575449773988}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 3]], "date-time": "2019-05-03T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1556841600000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.609", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 3]], "date-time": "2019-05-03T13:43:11Z", "timestamp": 1556890991000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Emerging Roles for Optimising Re-Use of Open Government Data"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "13", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2770-7466", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Fanghui", "family": "Xiao", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Liz", "family": "Lyon", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ning", "family": "Zou", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Robert M.", "family": "Gradeck", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 3]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/609/539", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/609/539", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 3]], "date-time": "2019-05-03T13:43:11Z", "timestamp": 1556890991000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.609", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T08:36:32Z", "timestamp": 1575448592597}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2019, 5, 1]], "date-time": "2019-05-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1556668800000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 2009 the Australian National Data Services (ANDS) has evolved and matured as a national infrastructure project.

We found that although few University of Michigan researchers have submitted data to Dryad, many have recently published articles in Dryad-integrated journals, suggesting significant opportunities for Dryad use on our campus. We suggest that academic libraries could promote the sharing and preservation of science and medical data by becoming Dryad members, purchasing vouchers to cover researchers\u2019 data submission costs, and hosting local curators who could directly work with campus researchers to improve the accuracy and completeness of data packages and thereby increase their potential for re-use.

Making data available also leaves data producers vulnerable to being scooped or data misuse. Data reusers also need to sink time and resources into evaluating data and trying to understand them, making collecting their own data a more attractive option. In spite of these difficulties, some data producers are looking for new ways to make data sharing and reuse a more viable option. This paper presents two cases from the surface and climate modeling communities, where researchers who produce data are reaching out to other researchers who would be interested in reusing the data. These cases are evaluated as a strategy to identify ways to overcome the challenges typically experienced by both data producers and data reusers. By working together with reusers, data producers are able to mitigate the disincentives and create incentives for sharing data.

In order to conform to these requirements, scholars need effective, easy-to-use tools and services for the long-term curation of their research data. The DataShare service, developed at the University of California, is being used by researchers to: (1) prepare for curation by reviewing best practice recommendations for the acquisition or creation of digital research data; (2) select datasets using intuitive file browsing and drag-and-drop interfaces; (3) describe their data for enhanced discoverability in terms of the DataCite metadata schema; (4) preserve their data by uploading to a public access collection in the UC3 Merritt curation repository; (5) cite their data in terms of persistent and globally-resolvable DOI identifiers; (6) expose their data through registration with well-known abstracting and indexing services and major internet search engines; (7) control the dissemination of their data through enforceable data use agreements; and (8) discover and retrieve datasets of interest through a faceted search and browse environment. Since the widespread adoption of effective data management practices is highly dependent on ease of use and integration into existing individual, institutional, and disciplinary workflows, the emphasis throughout the design and implementation of DataShare is to provide the highest level of curation service with the lowest possible technical barriers to entry by individual researchers.

These methods have made a significant contribution to the success of the project in securing trust in these datasets, which have been well used by other scientists.

As a humanistic science that can address almost any aspect of life with meaning to humans, cultural anthropology has proven difficult for librarians and archivists to effectively organize. Yet as anthropology moves onto the web, the challenge of organizing and curating information within the field only grows. In considering the subject classification of digital information in anthropology, I ask how we might best use controlled vocabularies for indexing digital anthropological data. After a brief discussion of likely concerns, I outline thesauri which may potentially be used for vocabulary control in metadata fields for language, location, culture, researcher, and subject. The article concludes with recommendations for those existing thesauri most suitable to provide a controlled vocabulary for describing digital objects in the anthropological world.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.290", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 7, 23]], "date-time": "2014-07-23T12:36:33Z", "timestamp": 1406118993000}, "page": "185-192", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Controlled Vocabulary Standards for Anthropological Datasets"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "9", "author": [{"given": "Celia", "family": "Emmelhainz", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2014, 5, 28]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.1.185/352", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.1.185/352", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:16:22Z", "timestamp": 1515021382000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 5, 28]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2014, 7, 23]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.290", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 5]], "date-time": "2019-12-05T00:59:47Z", "timestamp": 1575507587062}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores three stories, each occurring a year apart, illustrating an evolution toward a strategic vision for Library leadership in supporting research data management at the University of Sydney.

To prepare data for shared analysis, this project adapted editor-supervised review and revision processes familiar to conventional publishing, as well as more novel models of revision adapted from open source software development of public version control. Preparing the datasets for publication and analysis required significant investment of effort and expertise, including archaeological domain knowledge and familiarity with key ontologies. To organize this work effectively, we emphasized these different models of collaboration at various stages of this data publication and analysis project. Collaboration first centered on data editors working with data contributors, then widened to include other researchers who provided additional peer-review feedback, and finally the widest research community, whose collaboration is facilitated by GitHub\u2019s version control system.

These projects were chosen based on a number of criteria, including how they represented campus research, varieties of topics, researcher engagement, and the various services required. The pilot process began in September 2011, and will be completed in early 2014. Extensive lessons learned from the pilots are being compiled and are being used in the on-going design and implementation of the permanent Research Data Curation Program in the UC San Diego Library. In this paper, we present specific implementation details of these various services, as well as lessons learned. The program focused on many aspects of contemporary scholarship, including data creation and storage, description and metadata creation, citation and publication, and long term preservation and access. Based on the lessons learned in our processes, the Research Data Curation Program will provide a suite of services from which campus users can pick and choose, as necessary.

The latter is especially true in the U.S. in light of the recent White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) mandate aimed at maximizing the availability of all outputs \u2013 data as well as the publications that summarize them \u2013 resulting from federally-funded research projects. To aid researchers in creating effective data management plans (DMPs), a group of organizations \u2013 California Digital Library, DataONE, Digital Curation Centre, Smithsonian Institution, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and University of Virginia Library \u2013 collaborated on the development of the DMPTool, an online application that helps researchers create data management plans. The DMPTool provides detailed guidance, links to general and institutional resources, and walks a researcher through the process of generating a comprehensive plan tailored to specific DMP requirements. The uptake of the DMPTool has been positive: to date, it has been used by over 6,000 researchers from 800 institutions, making use of more than 20 requirements templates customized for funding bodies. With support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, project partners are now engaged in enhancing the features of the DMPTool. The second version of the tool has enhanced functionality for plan creators and institutional administrators, as well as a redesigned user interface and an open RESTful application programming interface (API). New administrative functions provide the means for institutions to better support local research activities. New capabilities include support for plan co-ownership; workflow provisions for internal plan review; simplified maintenance and addition of DMP requirements templates; extensive capabilities for the customization of guidance and resources by local institutional administrators; options for plan visibility; and UI refinements based on user feedback and focus group testing. The technical work undertaken for the DMPTool Version 2 has been accompanied by a new governance structure and the growth of a community of engaged stakeholders who will form the basis for a sustainable path forward for the DMPTool as it continues to play an important role in research data management activities.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.319", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 7, 23]], "date-time": "2014-07-23T12:36:33Z", "timestamp": 1406118993000}, "page": "324-330", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 4, "title": ["DMPTool 2: Expanding Functionality for Better Data Management Planning"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "9", "author": [{"given": "Carly", "family": "Strasser", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Stephen", "family": "Abrams", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Patricia", "family": "Cruse", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2014, 6, 17]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.1.324/361", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/9.1.324/361", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2018-01-03T23:15:04Z", "timestamp": 1515021304000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 6, 17]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2014, 7, 23]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v9i1.319", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 5]], "date-time": "2019-12-05T00:59:52Z", "timestamp": 1575507592607}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p> Persistent IDentifiers (PIDs), such as DOIs, Handles and ARK identifiers, play a significant role in the identification of a wide variety of assets that are created and used in scholarly endeavours, including research papers, datasets, images, etc. Motivated by concerns about long-term persistence, among others, PIDs are minted outside the information access protocol of the day, HTTP.

Progress on institutional policy was also evident. However, priorities did not seem to have shifted significantly. Open ended answers suggested that funder policy, rather than researcher demand, remained the main driver of service development and that resources and skills gaps remained issues. While widely understood as an important reference point and standard, because of their relatively recent publication date, FAIR principles had not been widely adopted explicitly in policy.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v14i1.595", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 9, 11]], "date-time": "2019-09-11T09:42:30Z", "timestamp": 1568194950000}, "page": "126-135", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Progress in Research Data Services"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "14", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2587-245X", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Andrew M", "family": "Cox", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1342-9853", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Mary Anne", "family": "Kennan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Elizabeth Josephine", "family": "Lyon", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4696-764X", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Stephen", "family": "Pinfield", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Laura", "family": "Sbaffi", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 9, 11]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/595/549", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/595/549", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 9, 11]], "date-time": "2019-09-11T09:42:30Z", "timestamp": 1568194950000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2019, 9, 11]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 9, 11]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v14i1.595", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 5]], "date-time": "2019-12-05T02:03:28Z", "timestamp": 1575511408082}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2019, 9, 11]], "date-time": "2019-09-11T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1568160000000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "funder": [{"DOI": "10.13039/100000015", "name": "U.S. Department of Energy", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "award": ["DESC0012704"]}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The National Synchrotron Light Source II operating at Brookhaven National Laboratory since 2014 for the US Department of Energy is one of the newest and brightest storage-ring synchrotron facility in the world.\u00a0 NSLS-II, like other facilities, provides pre-processing of the raw data and some analysis capabilities to its users.

Driving this effort has been two foundational principles: 1) theory and practice are always in conversation with each other and practical hands-on experience is as important as theoretical knowledge and understanding; and 2) the work of growing capability should be done in a spirt of collaboration and partnership, meeting each other as equals and learning from each other.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v14i1.638", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2020-01-03T12:11:23Z", "timestamp": 1578053483000}, "page": "262-274", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Building an Aotearoa New Zealand-wide Digital Curation Community of Practice"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "14", "author": [{"given": "Jessica", "family": "Moran", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Floran", "family": "Feltham", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Valerie", "family": "Love", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 3]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/638/564", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/638/564", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 3]], "date-time": "2020-01-03T12:11:23Z", "timestamp": 1578053483000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 9, 11]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v14i1.638", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 4]], "date-time": "2020-01-04T05:03:20Z", "timestamp": 1578114200401}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This article outlines the work that the University of Oxford is undertaking to implement a coordinated data management infrastructure.

The process of publishing data is complex and there are few guides that are practical or easy to understand. To bridge this gap, the Digital Curation and Data team at the University of Sydney Library initiated a project to develop applied data publication resources. To reflect current University and Library strategies, the team expanded the project to include a cultural competence review of each newly developed resource in order to reflect on the cultural biases that had gone into its creation and the ways in which the resource might appear through alternative cultural lenses, initially focusing on the data publication needs for research relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It may be especially challenging for researchers who are working with culturally sensitive data to find resources that are easy to use and relevant. One initial goal of this project is to ensure that researchers, students and staff can support the ethical and culturally appropriate publication of data relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, communities, and knowledges. The team reviewed prototyped resources with researchers who conduct research with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to assess their usefulness and identify gaps. Resources are now being updated to reflect feedback, and additional resources will also be created. The intention is to continue to integrate cultural competence into the University of Sydney\u2019s data curation and publication services and to expand this process to include wider cultural perspectives.&#x0D;\n\u00a0</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v14i1.648", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2019-12-23T15:17:18Z", "timestamp": 1577114238000}, "page": "168-179", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Developing Culturally Competent Data Publication Resources"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "14", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1974-1269", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Ryan", "family": "Stoker", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6321-9953", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Gene", "family": "Melzack", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6285-1340", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Jennifer", "family": "McLean", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/648/557", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/648/557", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 23]], "date-time": "2019-12-23T15:17:19Z", "timestamp": 1577114239000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 9, 11]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v14i1.648", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 22]], "date-time": "2019-12-22T23:40:11Z", "timestamp": 1577058011060}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]], "date-time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 0}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "funder": [{"DOI": "10.13039/100000208", "name": "Institute of Museum and Library Services", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher", "award": ["LG-73-17-0141-17"]}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This study identifies challenges and promising directions in the curation of 3D data. 3D visualization shows great promise for a range of scholarly fields through interactive engagement with and analysis of spatially complex artifacts, spaces, and data.

It proposes a new framing emanating out of the archival and record-keeping community \u2013 Human Security Informatics (HSI) \u2013 for human and humanitarian-centered rather than data, artifact or research-centered digital curation research and development. Human security is proposed as a new concept that promotes the protection and advancement of individuals and communities. It prioritizes individual agency and rights, and human-centered and multidisciplinary approaches that support democratization, transparency and accountability in trans- and supra-national governance and policy-making. Within this ethos, HSI specifically targets data, documentary, record-keeping and other accountability and evidentiary components of societal grand challenges. In so doing it necessarily highlights curation grand challenges, and demands the reorientation of some fundamental assumptions of digital curation relating to technological, economic and policy infrastructure priorities and standards, trust, scale, universality and content-centricity. To illustrate its argument, two research endeavors are discussed. The first is an Archival Education and Research Initiative (AERI) study that analyzed six areas of societal grand challenges and identified key, and often overlooked, areas where HSI could and should contribute. The analysis also surfaced grand challenges facing the digital curation community itself, many with particular applicability to digital curation capacity, processes and priorities in bureaucratic archives. The second is the Refugee Rights in Records (R3) Project, an example of wide-ranging HSI research that is focused on data, social media content and record-keeping, as well as on individual human rights in and to records and documentation. In both examples the paper identifies several specific areas of relevance to digital curation where an HSI approach would be appropriate.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v14i1.636", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 2]], "date-time": "2020-01-02T16:00:31Z", "timestamp": 1577980831000}, "page": "228-237", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Human Security Informatics, Global Grand Challenges and Digital Curation"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "14", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4897-7780", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Anne J.", "family": "Gilliland", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "James", "family": "Lowry", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/636/560", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/636/560", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 2]], "date-time": "2020-01-02T16:00:31Z", "timestamp": 1577980831000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1970, 1, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 9, 11]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v14i1.636", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 2]], "date-time": "2020-01-02T16:48:32Z", "timestamp": 1577983712926}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 2]], "date-time": "2020-01-02T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1577923200000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Research is a core function of cultural heritage organisations.

The study reveals that research data management at HRP is underdeveloped, while highlighting some causes for optimism. The results of the study are compared to the results of similar studies conducted in UK higher education institutions (HEIs), highlighting the many discrepancies in the ways that research data is managed at HRP and in the HE sector.

Digital identifiers have become the key to preserving and accessing content, just as physical identifier tags have been the key to accessing paper-based content and other physical entities for millennia. Two main schools of thought have emerged: on the one hand, librarians and public repositories have pushed the concept of the Persistent Identifier (PI) as a way to guarantee long term identification and (sometimes) access; on the other hand, the extraordinary success of the web has led several researchers and web experts to push the concept of the Cool URI as the universal mechanism for identifying and accessing digital content. Both views have their pros and cons, but so far (with only a few exceptions) the two visions have developed in parallel, sometimes with a subtle underlying hostility.In this paper, we present the evolution of the Entity Name System (ENS), an open service-based platform developed as part of the OKKAM EU co-funded project, which can reconcile these two approaches.

To help make this interoperability possible, an OJS Dataverse plugin and Data Deposit API are being developed, which together will allow authors to submit their articles and datasets through an existing journal management interface, while the underlying data are seamlessly deposited into a research data repository, such as the Harvard Dataverse.

Additionally, many researchers wish to make their data available regardless of funder requirements both to enhance their impact and also to propel the concept of open science. However, the data curation activities that support these preservation and sharing activities are costly, requiring advanced curation practices, training, specific technical competencies, and relevant subject expertise. Few colleges or universities will\u00a0be able to hire and sustain all of the data curation expertise locally that its researchers will require, and even those with the means to do more will benefit from a collective approach that will allow them to supplement at peak times, access specialized capacity when infrequently-curated types arise, and stabilize service levels to account for local staff transition, such as during turn-over periods. The Data Curation Network (DCN) provides a solution for partners of all sizes to develop or to supplement local curation expertise with the expertise of a resilient, distributed network, and creates a funding stream to both sustain central services and support expansion of distributed expertise over time. This paper presents our next steps for piloting the DCN, scheduled to launch in the spring of 2018 across nine partner institutions. Our implementation plan is based on planning phase research performed from 2016-2017 that monitored the types, disciplines, frequency, and curation needs of data sets passing through the curation services at the six planning phase institutions. Our DCN implementation plan includes a well-coordinated and tiered staffing model, a technology-agnostic submission workflow, standardized curation procedures, and a sustainability approach that will allow the DCN to prevail beyond the grant-supported implementation phase as a curation-as-service model.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.616", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]], "date-time": "2018-12-28T14:43:50Z", "timestamp": 1546008230000}, "page": "125-140", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["Data Curation Network: A Cross-Institutional Staffing Model for Curating Research Data"], "prefix": "10.2218", "volume": "13", "author": [{"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6908-9240", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Lisa R", "family": "Johnston", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jake", "family": "Carlson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Cynthia", "family": "Hudson-Vitale", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Heidi", "family": "Imker", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Wendy", "family": "Kozlowski", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Robert", "family": "Olendorf", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Claire", "family": "Stewart", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Mara", "family": "Blake", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Joel", "family": "Herndon", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Timothy M.", "family": "McGeary", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Elizabeth", "family": "Hull", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5235", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 26]]}, "container-title": ["International Journal of Digital Curation"], "link": [{"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/616/519", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://www.ijdc.net/article/download/616/519", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]], "date-time": "2018-12-28T14:44:00Z", "timestamp": 1546008240000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 26]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 28]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v13i1.616", "ISSN": ["1746-8256"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1746-8256", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3, 13]], "date-time": "2020-03-13T23:43:35Z", "timestamp": 1584143015650}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJDC"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes the initial results from the Data Information Literacy (DIL) project designed to identify the educational needs of graduate students across a variety of science disciplines and respond with effective educational interventions to meet those needs.
