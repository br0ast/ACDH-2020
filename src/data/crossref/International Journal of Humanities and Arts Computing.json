However, their archives have been slow to grow. This article is directed toward historians who are contemplating such projects. Repository development is very valuable. On the other hand, studies show that repository projects that rely upon voluntary contribution from numerous researchers seldom reach critical mass. Our surveys and our study of the Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis Data Hoover Project confirm this assessment. We conclude that historical data repositories remain poorly aligned with present day scholarly practices and are unlikely to realize their promise until the social life of data becomes a part of the profession. Because we believe that this is possible we introduce four strategies, each one backed by a successful project, that will help to make data sharing a part of professional practice. These suggestions are: 1) hiring \u2018data hoovers\u2019 to solicit and curate data, 2) appealing to close-knit communities and networking their domain-specific archives, 3) rightsizing crowdsourcing tasks, and 4) incorporating peer review. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2016.0170", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 9, 14]], "date-time": "2016-09-14T08:27:05Z", "timestamp": 1473841625000}, "page": "205-224", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 4, "title": ["Don't Just Build It, They Probably Won't Come: Data Sharing and the Social Life of Data in the Historical Quantitative Social Sciences"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Ruth", "family": "Mostern", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Marieka", "family": "Arksey", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T15:42:43Z", "timestamp": 1566488563000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2016.0170"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2016.0170", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 1, 7]], "date-time": "2020-01-07T17:03:59Z", "timestamp": 1578416639626}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> The Bentham Papers Transcription Initiative <jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (Transcribe Bentham for short) is an award-winning crowdsourced manuscript transcription initiative which engages students, researchers, and the general public with the thought and life of the philosopher and reformer, Jeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832), by making available digital images of his manuscripts for anyone, anywhere in the world, to transcribe. Since its launch in September 2010, over 2.6 million words have been transcribed by volunteers. This paper will examine Transcribe Bentham's contribution to humanities research and the burgeoning field of digital humanities. It will then discuss the potential for the project's volunteers to make significant new discoveries among the vast Bentham Papers collection, and examine several examples of interesting material transcribed by volunteers thus far. We demonstrate here that a crowd-sourced initiative such as Transcribe Bentham can open up activities that were traditionally viewed as academic endeavors to a wider audience interested in history, whilst uncovering new, important historical primary source material. In addition, we see this as a switch in focus for those involved in digital humanities, highlighting the possibilities in using online and social media technologies for user engagement and participation in cultural heritage. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2014.0119", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4, 9]], "date-time": "2014-04-09T09:20:58Z", "timestamp": 1397035258000}, "page": "46-64", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 12, "title": ["Crowdsourcing Bentham: Beyond the Traditional Boundaries of Academic History"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Tim", "family": "Causer", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Melissa", "family": "Terras", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T14:16:42Z", "timestamp": 1566483402000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2014.0119"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2014.0119", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 20]], "date-time": "2019-11-20T18:54:02Z", "timestamp": 1574276042470}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2007, 10]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/e1753854808000244", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2009, 1, 20]], "date-time": "2009-01-20T17:26:10Z", "timestamp": 1232472370000}, "page": "151-185", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Automatic Coding of Printed Materials"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "1", "author": [{"given": "JOHANN", "family": "PETER MURMANN", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "ERNST", "family": "HOMBURG", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "RUUD", "family": "GEVEN", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Y.

The point of departure for our investigation were distances between 15 Norwegian dialects as perceived by Norwegian listeners. We correlated these perceptual distances with objective phonetic distances measured on the basis of the transcriptions of the recordings used in the perception experiment. In addition, we correlated the perceptual distances with objective distances based on other datasets. On the basis of the correlation results and multiple regression analyses we conclude that the listeners did not base their judgments solely on information that they heard during the experiments but also on their general knowledge of the dialects. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the effect is stronger for the group of listeners who recognised the dialects than for listeners who did not recognise the dialects on the tape. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/e175385480900041x", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2009, 9, 17]], "date-time": "2009-09-17T10:59:27Z", "timestamp": 1253185167000}, "page": "243-259", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["What Role does Dialect Knowledge Play in the Perception of Linguistic Distances?"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "2", "author": [{"given": "Wilbert", "family": "Heeringa", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Charlotte", "family": "Gooskens", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Koenraad", "family": "De Smedt", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "reference": [{"key": "b1", "DOI": "10.1017/S0332586505001319", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b2", "DOI": "10.1017/S0954394504163023", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b3", "DOI": "10.1093/llc/fql038", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b4", "DOI": "10.3115/1641976.1641984", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b5", "unstructured": "W.

First, a regression analysis of data taken from a large lexical database of Limburgish dialects in Belgium and The Netherlands is conducted to illustrate that concept characteristics such as concept salience, concept vagueness and negative affect contribute to the lexical heterogeneity in the dialect data. Next, it is shown that the relationship between concept characteristics and lexical heterogeneity influences the results of conventional lexical dialectometric measurements. Finally, a dialectometric procedure is proposed which downplays this undesired influence, thus making it possible to obtain a clearer picture of the \u2018truly\u2019 regional variation. More specifically, a lexical dialectometric method is proposed in which concept characteristics form the basis of a weighting schema that determines to which extent concept specific dissimilarities can contribute to the aggregate dissimilarities between locations. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/e1753854809000408", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2009, 9, 17]], "date-time": "2009-09-17T10:59:27Z", "timestamp": 1253185167000}, "page": "221-242", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["The Role of Concept Characteristics in Lexical Dialectometry"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "2", "author": [{"given": "Dirk", "family": "Speelman", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Dirk", "family": "Geeraerts", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "reference": [{"key": "b1", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9780511805103", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b2", "author": "Geeraerts D.", "year": "1999", "volume-title": "Convergentie en divergentie in de Nederlandse woordenschat.

The correlation analysis was performed by combining two complementary approaches proposed in dialectometric literature, namely by computing both global and place-specific correlation measures and by inspecting their spatial distribution.

We correlated the results of an experiment on word intelligibility with eleven linguistic factors and carried out logistic regression analyses. In the experiment, the intelligibility of 384 frequent Swedish words was tested among Danish listeners via the Internet. The choice of eleven linguistic factors was motivated by their contribution to intelligibility in earlier studies. The highest correlation was found in the negative correlation between word intelligibility and phonetic distances. Also word length, different syllable numbers, foreign sounds, neighbourhood density, word frequency, orthography, and the absence of the prosodic phenomenon of \u2018st\u00f8d\u2019 in Swedish contribute significantly to intelligibility. Although the results thus show that linguistic factors contribute to the intelligibility of single words, the amount of explained variance was not very large (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (Cox and Snell)=.16, R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (Nagelkerke)=.21) when compared with earlier studies which were based on aggregate intelligibility. Partly, the lower scores result from the logistic regression model used. It was necessary to use logistic regression in our study because the intelligibility scores were coded in a binary variable. Additionally, we attribute the lower correlation to the higher number of idiosyncrasies of single words compared with the aggregate intelligibility and linguistic distance used in earlier studies. Based on observations in the actual data from the intelligibility experiment, we suggest further steps to be taken to improve the predictability of word intelligibility. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/e1753854809000329", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2009, 9, 17]], "date-time": "2009-09-17T10:59:27Z", "timestamp": 1253185167000}, "page": "83-100", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 10, "title": ["Linguistic Determinants of the Intelligibility of Swedish Words among Danes"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "2", "author": [{"given": "Sebastian", "family": "K\u00fcrschner", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Charlotte", "family": "Gooskens", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ren\u00e9e", "family": "van Bezooijen", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "reference": [{"key": "b1", "author": "Beijering K.", "first-page": "13", "year": "2008", "volume-title": "Linguistics in the Netherlands"}, {"key": "b2", "DOI": "10.1075/hsm.6.17bez", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b3", "author": "Birch-Jensen J.", "year": "2007", "volume-title": "Fr\u00e5n rista till chatta.

We apply Levenshtein distance to dialect data from Bai ( Allen, 2004 ), a Sino-Tibetan language, and Hongshuihe (HSH) Zhuang (Castro and Hansen, accepted), a Tai language. In applying Levenshtein distance to languages with contour tone systems, we ask the following questions: 1) How much variation in intelligibility can tone alone explain? and 2) Which representation of tone results in the Levenshtein distance that shows the strongest correlation with intelligibility test results? This research evaluates six representations of tone: onset, contour and offset; onset and contour only; contour and offset only; target approximation ( Xu &amp; Wang, 2001 ), autosegments of H and L, and Chao's (1930) pitch numbers. For both languages, the more fully explicit onset-contour-offset and onset-contour representations showed significantly stronger inverse correlations with intelligibility.

as its aim the investigation of the complex connections between the different kinds and sites of entertainment, and between the people and communities involved in making and watching performance, in what was then the rapidly developing East Midlands town of mid-Victorian Nottingham. As questions of space, proximity and temporal relationships are central to the choice-making processes of both venue managers and potential spectators, so we sought to create a resource, based on a map of nineteenth-century Nottingham, that organised information about the town and its performance culture in ways that highlighted such connections and allowed us to explore the relationships between place, performance and audience within the town. Here we describe the creation of the resource and reflect on the development of our spatio-temporal mapping approach, arguing that this offers the potential to address patterns of connectivity and change across both time and space, not as a series of disconnected cross sections but rather as representative of the \u2018world of process\u2019 in which the events we study actually take place. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2011.0027", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 10, 28]], "date-time": "2011-10-28T10:29:38Z", "timestamp": 1319797778000}, "page": "103-126", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["Mapping the Moment: a spatio-temporal interface for studying performance culture, Nottingham, 1857\u20131867"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "5", "author": [{"given": "Jo", "family": "Robinson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Gary", "family": "Priestnall", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Richard", "family": "Tyler-Jones", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Robin", "family": "Burgess", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T13:31:38Z", "timestamp": 1566480698000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2011, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2011.0027"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2011.0027", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T09:04:40Z", "timestamp": 1574413480947}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2011, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Whilst the application of online multimedia digital technology within arts and humanities research has burgeoned over the last decade, the practice of openly conducting collaborative and in particular discursive research publicly online remains one of the most unfamiliar and conceptually problematic areas for many academics in the field.

Rakuch\u016b rakugai zu provide bird's-eye views of the then-capital city of Kyoto, including buildings, natural features, and human activities. The methodology introduced here uses GIS spatial analysis functions to scan the painting surface onto a survey coordinate grid based on the relative positions of landmarks in the painting. The analytic sequence is as follows: (1)\u00a0derive coordinate values for landmarks both on the painting and on a survey coordinate grid; (2)\u00a0generate a link table from these two point-data sets; (3)\u00a0use the projective transformation and rubber sheeting techniques to project the painting surface onto the survey coordinate grid; and (4)\u00a0project the areas of the rubber sheet-derived polygons onto the painting. This process gives visual representation to differences between real space and the depicted space. Results show that rakuch\u016b rakugai zu painted in the seventeenth century and later distorted real space more than those painted in the sixteenth century, indicating a decrease in adherence to conventional perspective-based painting. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2009.0008", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 6, 9]], "date-time": "2010-06-09T13:02:57Z", "timestamp": 1276088577000}, "page": "39-60", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Unfolding the landscape drawing method of Rakuch\u016b Rakugai Zu screen paintings in a GIS environment"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Akihiro", "family": "Tsukamoto", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T12:38:27Z", "timestamp": 1566477507000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2009.0008"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2009.0008", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:11:05Z", "timestamp": 1574435465048}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the early drivers of historical GIS was the development of national historical GISs.

This paper takes one of these systems, the Great Britain Historical GIS, and explores how it was built, what methodologies were developed to exploit the data that it contains, and provides an example to demonstrate how it made possible a unique analysis of railroads in Wales before the First World War. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2009.0013", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 6, 9]], "date-time": "2010-06-09T13:02:57Z", "timestamp": 1276088577000}, "page": "143-161", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["National Historical Geographical Information System as a tool for historical research: Population and railways in Wales, 1841\u20131911"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Ian", "family": "Gregory", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Robert M.", "family": "Schwartz", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T12:38:37Z", "timestamp": 1566477517000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2009.0013"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2009.0013", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T15:11:05Z", "timestamp": 1574435465058}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper assesses the role and potential of Cultural Virtual Reality (CVR) for the modelling of archaeological landscapes.

Developments in the publication of e-Books and production of e-readers also are happening daily. Currently, young people who live in highly technological areas are exposed to books not only through an adult's reading, but also by independently accessing e-Books which are available on the internet or on CD-ROMs. These multimedia tools usually provide assistance in oral reading, written text, oral discourse, music, sound effects, and animations 1 . The main purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of integrating e-Books into elementary school science and technology classes on students' learning effectiveness. This study employed nonequivalent group pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design which consisted of conducting learning activities for 20 minutes a period, three periods a week, for a total of six weeks. In this study, there were 60 elementary sixth-grade students who were equally divided into an experimental group and a control group. The experiment design applied an e-Book Learning method for the experimental group and a Paper-Based Learning method for the control group, respectively. The instruments of this study consisted of three scales: (1) learning motivation scale, (2) learning attitude scale, and (3) learning effectiveness scale. After the experimental instruction, the data were analysed using seven different statistical methods: a Pearson correlation analysis, canonical correlation analysis, one-way MANCOVA, one-way MANOVA, one-way ANCOVA, path analysis, t-test, and paired t-test. These statistical methods enabled us to reach four conclusions: (1) There was no significant difference in learning effectiveness of e-Books integrated instruction between students of different sexes; (2) There was significant correlation between learning motivation and learning effectiveness of science and technology domain for the experimental group students; (3) There was significant correlation between learning attitudes and learning effectiveness in the science and technology domain for the experimental group students; (4) The experimental group students had a positive attitude toward e-Books integrated instruction. They thought the use of e-Books could enhance learning effectiveness and improve learning motivation. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2012.0051", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 2, 16]], "date-time": "2012-02-16T10:43:27Z", "timestamp": 1329389007000}, "page": "224-235", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["The learning effectiveness of integrating e-books into elementary school science and technology classes"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Jia-Rong", "family": "Wen", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ming Kuang", "family": "Chuang", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Sheng-Huang", "family": "Kuo", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T17:04:40Z", "timestamp": 1566493480000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2012.0051"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2012.0051", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T20:04:30Z", "timestamp": 1574453070181}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This article introduces a case of across sectors partnerships related to the digitalisation of the industrial heritage in Taiwan.

The Library of Congress has been in the forefront of developing digital collections and providing digital access to its collections via the Internet. The Library's American Memory collection is described here, from its origins in the 1980s to its current format. American Memory's access to the Geography and Map collections is profiled, with features of the digital collection presented in detail. American Memory is constantly undergoing revision. The Geography and Map division currently features collections highlighting the American Civil War, Liberia, the Revolutionary war, early railroad maps, the Louisiana Purchase, and U.S. National Parks. The wealth of information contained in the map collection makes these digitisation efforts worthwhile even though only a small percentage of the total items can be posted online. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2012.0041", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 2, 16]], "date-time": "2012-02-16T10:43:27Z", "timestamp": 1329389007000}, "page": "100-110", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["From Washington to the world: maps and digital archives at the Library of Congress"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Min", "family": "Zhang", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T17:04:30Z", "timestamp": 1566493470000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2012.0041"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2012.0041", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T20:04:30Z", "timestamp": 1574453070201}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> ALA-accredited programs for Master of Library and Information Studies, are offered only in 63 of the total 3000 colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.

Consequently, museums and private collections all over the world have rich holdings of Japanese decorative arts. Despite their popularity and profound influence on Western applied arts, the systematic research of Japanese decorative arts in Western collections is backward compared to the investigation of other art forms. It is actually difficult to gain access to the objects scattered in numerous collections or to achieve high-quality images, not to mention that there are only a few specialists capable of documenting the objects. Generally, that is why there are only very few online databases dedicated to decorative arts. The Art Research Centre, Ritsumeikan University (Kyoto, Japan), has developed databases of various Japanese cultural assets, tangible as well as intangible art forms and, based on the expertise in developing scholarly databases, has launched online image databases of three-dimensional art objects.

The authors developed an educational game with a vision-based interface and a keyboard/mouse to compare the differences in children's learning experiences when using different input interfaces. The evaluation of the proposed system was based on the questionnaire findings; the participants are 60 third- and fourth-grade students in Taiwan. The authors addressed the issue of the participants' experience in gender and personal preferences for computer games. Through the questionnaire and data analysis, this study found that a vision-based interface not only attracts the interest of children, but also stimulates their learning motivation. The findings have highlighted the value of the present CAI system with a vision-based interface and confirmed an improvement in learning motivation. Classroom observation indicates that the introduction of a CAI system with a novel interface can be a useful tool for enhancing classroom learning activities. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2012.0047", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 2, 16]], "date-time": "2012-02-16T10:43:27Z", "timestamp": 1329389007000}, "page": "172-183", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["A computer-assisted instruction system with a vision-based interactive interface for children"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "6", "author": [{"given": "Hsueh-Wu", "family": "Wang", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Wei-Hsien", "family": "Wu", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Su-Ju", "family": "Lu", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ping-Lin", "family": "Fan", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ya-Ting", "family": "Lo", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T17:04:35Z", "timestamp": 1566493475000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2012.0047"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2012.0047", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T20:04:30Z", "timestamp": 1574453070315}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2012.0032", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2012, 2, 16]], "date-time": "2012-02-16T10:43:27Z", "timestamp": 1329389007000}, "page": "vii-viii", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Editors' Note"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "6", "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T17:04:23Z", "timestamp": 1566493463000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2012.0032"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2012.0032", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 22]], "date-time": "2019-11-22T20:04:30Z", "timestamp": 1574453070312}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2012, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program (TELDAP) is a long-term, multi-generational, cross-divisional programme that will enhance the cultural, academic, socio-economic and educational values of Taiwan Digital Archives.

It concludes with an example of how these media literacy workshops, indirectly, had surprisingly positive affects on a dyslexic student by scaffolding his learning and providing him with alternative entry points to learning whereby he was empowered to confidently articulate History of Art's signature disciplinary skills-set at a foundation level: critical visual analysis. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2011.0014", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 24]], "date-time": "2011-03-24T11:14:24Z", "timestamp": 1300965264000}, "page": "151-165", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Too much information: Why facilitate information and media literacy?"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "James G.

In order to accomplish these comparisons, a tool known as the TEI-Comparator was created. This is a bespoke fuzzy text comparison engine with a frontend web interface designed for the project. The TEI-Comparator automatically matches reorganised and fragmented paragraphs in the two editions. It is then used for confirming, removing, creating and annotating the links between the editions. This article describes the steps necessary to use the TEI-Comparator, its comparison algorithm, and the handling of the output it creates with respect to its use for The Holinshed Project. The TEI-Comparator was launched in 2009 as an open source project on Sourceforge and is available for other projects to use. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2011.0006", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 24]], "date-time": "2011-03-24T11:14:24Z", "timestamp": 1300965264000}, "page": "39-53", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["The Holinshed Project: Comparing and linking two editions of Holinshed's Chronicle"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "James", "family": "Cummings", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Arno", "family": "Mittelbach", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T13:38:01Z", "timestamp": 1566481081000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2010, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2010, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2011.0006"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2011.0006", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T09:34:14Z", "timestamp": 1574501654468}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2010, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Documents of all forms have always been at the centre of research in the humanities and arts. As more literature becomes available electronically, the impact of the digital medium on reading and research also grows. This article provides a review of key research on the limitations of digital reading, spanning a twenty-year period. Most of this literature is from the computer science field of human-computer interaction. From this backdrop, this article reports the main findings of a series of detailed studies that have investigated the current difficulties and limitations of digital document reader software. These studies, all conducted in the last four years, demonstrate that there are major limitations in digital document reader software that impede a number of simple interactions between user and document. It is also demonstrated that the current problems with this software can be overcome through a re-design of the human-computer interface. Ultimately, the current shortcomings of digital document reader software are a major impediment to realising the full potential of digital humanities. However, there is ample scope to make tangible improvements and progress is urgently needed. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2011.0012", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 24]], "date-time": "2011-03-24T11:14:24Z", "timestamp": 1300965264000}, "page": "125-139", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["The usability of digital documents \u2013 A barrier to digital scholarship"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "George", "family": "Buchanan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T13:38:08Z", "timestamp": 1566481088000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2010, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2010, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2011.0012"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2011.0012", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T09:34:14Z", "timestamp": 1574501654468}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2010, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> The work of scholars is rapidly changing.

This paper presents the results of a JISC-funded project aimed at the generation of a 3D online museum of an internationally important collection of Egyptological artefacts that have not previously been publicly available. The results from the project demonstrate the value of 3D museums, in addition to highlighting some of the future possibilities for interaction with objects and the ways in which such virtual museums can revolutionise access to collections for education and public interest. It also stresses ways in which such collections can benefit scholars in terms of reference collections, object analysis and interpretation. The question of objectivity and authenticity of virtual collections, in comparison with real objects is raised. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2011.0009", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3, 24]], "date-time": "2011-03-24T11:14:24Z", "timestamp": 1300965264000}, "page": "81-93", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["The Eton Myers collection virtual museum"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "4", "author": [{"given": "Henry P.", "family": "Chapman", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Vincent L.", "family": "Gaffney", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Helen L.", "family": "Moulden", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T13:38:04Z", "timestamp": 1566481084000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2010, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2010, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2011.0009"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2011.0009", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T09:34:14Z", "timestamp": 1574501654494}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2010, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing upon previous theoretical and practical work in historical and qualitative applications of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), this paper, in Giles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari's terminology, conceptualizes GIS as \u2018an abstract machine\u2019 which plays a \u2018piloting role\u2019 which does not \u2018function to represent\u2019 something real, but rather \u2018constructs a real which is yet to come.\u2019 To illustrate this digital humanities mapping methodology, the essay examines Irish writer Patrick Kavanagh's novel The Green Fool (1938) and epic poem The Great Hunger (1946) and their respective contrasting topophilic and topophobic renderings of landscape, identity and sense of place under the lens M.M.

The development of a generalised model of performer-activity in live performance is then introduced together with logical structures developed from the generic model which inform the language design and allow it to integrate with a wide range of performance traditions and genres. The implementation and application of these ideas in developing the Emerge language is explored through both a formal grammar and a discussion of the choices that had to be made between ease of use for the intended target users and grammatical simplicity.

The processing techniques that are applied in this process are commonly used for the processing of satellite imagery. The paper maps were scanned and geo-referenced. Image filtering techniques were used to eliminate the cartographic elements like text and boundaries. Land-use classes were created from the colours in the maps using image classification techniques. As a last step, GIS filtering functions were used to eliminate remaining cartographic elements and small classification errors. The HISLU60 database contains six land-use classes; arable land, grassland, forest, non-agricultural land, inland water and urban. It is a raster dataset with a cell size of 250 meters. The HISLU60 database was validated by performing a statistical comparison with three reference datasets. The overall classification accuracy is around 50 percent. Despite its limitations, the HISLU60 database gives an overview of the pan-European land use around 1960. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2011.0020", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 6, 22]], "date-time": "2011-06-22T14:48:22Z", "timestamp": 1308754102000}, "page": "41-58", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Historical land use databases: a new layer of information for geographical research"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "5", "author": [{"given": "H.

This form of instruction not only has helped in reducing the problem of managing and testing large classes, but it also has helped lecturers in providing valuable assistance to students who would otherwise not have such access. The limitations of the e-learning platform coupled with a distorted student-teacher ratio has raised concerns about quality, especially for traditional humanities disciplines where the emphasis on argumentative rigor and critical thinking are at odds with the science-leaning orientation of e-learning platforms. This concern is especially important because the technology is relatively new and there are problems of access not only in terms of infrastructure but also in terms of the relevant computer literacy skills required of users of the technology. This essay examines the problems associated with the use of e-learning in teaching and examining traditional humanities courses in general but especially the problems encountered in using e-learning in teaching and assessing critical thinking courses at the University of Botswana. I argue that although certain aspects of e-learning are structured, confining, and therefore unsuitable for traditional humanities disciplines, e-learning can still be an appropriate tool for the humanities if used appropriately and creatively. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2011.0022", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 6, 22]], "date-time": "2011-06-22T14:48:22Z", "timestamp": 1308754102000}, "page": "83-101", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["E-learning platforms and humanities education: an African case study"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "5", "author": [{"given": "Ibanga B.", "family": "Ikpe", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T11:51:19Z", "timestamp": 1566474679000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2011.0022"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2011.0022", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T14:43:48Z", "timestamp": 1574520228677}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2011.0023", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2011, 6, 22]], "date-time": "2011-06-22T14:48:22Z", "timestamp": 1308754102000}, "page": "iv-iv", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Erratum"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "5", "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T11:51:11Z", "timestamp": 1566474671000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2011.0023"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2011.0023", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T14:43:48Z", "timestamp": 1574520228678}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2011, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> The act of classification has the widest implications for scholarship.

It uses logic programming to articulate rules to develop a longitudinal approach which chains together individual Land Tax records for successive years to identify perduring property objects, which are then located geographically using the pooled descriptors drawn from the returns. It investigates not only house repopulation, but also the character of new property development, of sub-division and amalgamation of holdings and the changing control of housing. It allows a remarkably detailed reconstruction of change in the particular locality, revealing events that have gone unnoticed. Pent-up demand associated with proto-industrialization combined with the self-interest of a major absentee landlord to allow a flurry of small scale construction between 1785 and 1805; property then converted to workers\u2019 housing with the onset of industrial urbanism. More generally, it is suggested that a computational approach of this sort allows for a more serious engagement with a source all too often dismissed as unpromising. The paper concludes by drawing out implications of the work for more traditional approaches to interpreting Land Tax returns. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2014.0127", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10, 7]], "date-time": "2014-10-07T15:37:00Z", "timestamp": 1412696220000}, "page": "125-186", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Reconstructing Urbanization of a Pennine Fringe Township Through Computational Chaining of Land Tax Records: Mottram in Longdendale 1784\u20131830"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Peter", "family": "Bibby", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T16:59:57Z", "timestamp": 1566493197000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2014.0127"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2014.0127", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 23]], "date-time": "2019-11-23T23:24:07Z", "timestamp": 1574551447791}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Prime Minister Robert Peel was forced to resign in 1846 over the Repeal of the Corn Laws.

The result was a serious split within the Conservative Party over the Corn Laws. The majority of Conservatives voted against their own government, while 114 \u2018Peelite\u2019 Conservatives voted with Peel and the government.

The Edinburgh Language Technology Group (LTG) has developed the Edinburgh Geoparser, a system that can automatically recognise place name mentions in text and disambiguate them with respect to a gazetteer. The recognition step is required to identify location mentions in a given piece of text. The subsequent disambiguation step, generally referred to as georesolution, grounds location mentions to their corresponding gazetteer entries with latitude and longitude values, for example, to visualise them on a map. Geoparsing is not only useful for mapping purposes but also for making document collections more accessible as it can provide additional metadata about the geographical content of documents. Combined with other information mined from text such as person names and date expressions, complex relations between such pieces of information can be identified. The Edinburgh Geoparser can be used with several gazetteers including Unlock and GeoNames to process a variety of input texts. The original version of the Geoparser was a demonstrator configured for modern text. Since then, it has been adapted to georeference historic and ancient text collections as well as modern-day newspaper text. <jats:sup>1</jats:sup> <jats:sup>,</jats:sup> <jats:sup>2</jats:sup> <jats:sup>,</jats:sup> <jats:sup>3</jats:sup> <jats:sup>,</jats:sup> <jats:sup>4</jats:sup> Currently, the LTG is involved in three research projects applying the Geoparser to historical text collections of very different types and for a variety of end-user applications.

These results indicate that the Iliadic network is a small-world network, rather dissasortative and relatively easy to disconnect. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2015.0141", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3, 4]], "date-time": "2015-03-04T08:37:04Z", "timestamp": 1425458224000}, "page": "115-132", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 6, "title": ["Homer's Iliad\u00a0\u2013\u00a0A Social Network Analytic Approach"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "9", "author": [{"given": "Dimitrios", "family": "Kydros", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Panagiotis", "family": "Notopoulos", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Georgios", "family": "Exarchos", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T11:28:45Z", "timestamp": 1566473325000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2015.0141"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2015.0141", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T15:52:23Z", "timestamp": 1574697143222}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2016.0168", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 9, 14]], "date-time": "2016-09-14T08:27:05Z", "timestamp": 1473841625000}, "page": "vii-viii", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Notes on Contributors"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "10", "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T15:42:20Z", "timestamp": 1566488540000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2016.0168"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2016.0168", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T15:52:23Z", "timestamp": 1574697143222}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2016.0167", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 9, 14]], "date-time": "2016-09-14T08:27:05Z", "timestamp": 1473841625000}, "page": "v-vi", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Editors' Note"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "10", "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T15:42:19Z", "timestamp": 1566488539000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2016.0167"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2016.0167", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 25]], "date-time": "2019-11-25T15:52:23Z", "timestamp": 1574697143285}, "reference-count": 43, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2016, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is an exploratory study using a smallholding diary and GIS to project the spatio-temporal pattern of a smallholding's travel in late nineteenth century Sweden.

While the smallholding also used railways to visit distant places, it was primarily their produce that travelled further unto international markets. This also influenced the smallholding demography, from an extended household towards a nuclear family. As market demands shifted from subsistence to dairy products, the smallholding contracted primarily female farm servants due to their specialisation in milking. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2016.0169", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 9, 14]], "date-time": "2016-09-14T08:27:05Z", "timestamp": 1473841625000}, "page": "179-204", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Smallholding Travel in the Agrarian Revolution: Using a Farmer Diary to Map Spatio-temporal Patterns in Late Nineteenth Century Sweden"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Johan", "family": "G\u00e4rdebo", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Daniel", "family": "L\u00f6wenborg", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "reference": [{"key": "b7", "author": "Holmqvist Pelle", "year": "2013", "volume-title": "Interview with a long-distance ice-skater"}, {"key": "b14", "author": "Bayly C.

We provide a detailed overview of the history of such conversion tables and find that the modelling of these tables into the digital follows a trend of increasingly detailed computation of chronological time. The Buddhist Studies Time Authority Database was designed to allow computational conversion of the Chinese, the Japanese and the Korean Calendar, between each other, as well as with the Gregorian, proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendar.

A systematic description is essential for enabling weavers to document and secure intellectual property rights, and for preserving their rich cultural heritage. We present a linked data structure for modelling non-rectilinear as well as rectilinear weaving patterns, different from both a grid and a topological representation.

We developed a deep mapping project where museum visitors a) interface with web-delivered, time-enabled animated maps on standing gallery tables, b) compare historic photos with adjacent contemporary street views on those maps, and c) engage with other geovisualizations that portray historical and geographical change. Visitors also have the opportunity to use mobile devices to take walking tours throughout the city, and to provide their own content and directions for the project. This hybrid of scholarly-led, multi-media narratives blended with public participation and open navigation can be a template for other deep-mapping projects to create connections to place. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2017.0181", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 3, 7]], "date-time": "2017-03-07T10:32:23Z", "timestamp": 1488882743000}, "page": "109-125", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["\u2018The Story of Us\u2019: Place-Making through Public Interaction with Digital GeoHumanities in Colorado Springs"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "John", "family": "Harner", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Kevin", "family": "Knapp", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Leah", "family": "Davis-Witherow", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T13:12:32Z", "timestamp": 1566479552000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2017, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2017.0181"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2017.0181", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 26]], "date-time": "2019-11-26T08:17:58Z", "timestamp": 1574756278511}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2017, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper showcases a counter-mapping project with the Tlingit and Tagish peoples of the circumpolar north.

Surprisingly, perhaps, this model does not deal directly with a charter's text and is not mark-up based. Instead, it draws on the authors\u2019 experience with the construction of three highly structured factoid-oriented prosopographical databases that drew heavily on charter sources, and that also did not explicitly contain a digital representation of the charter texts. The paper explains the way in which the structured data model thus derived differs from text-oriented approaches such as TEI/CEI work that has been done so far on charters. It presents a view on why this factoid-based model seems to capture more readily some of the complexity in the apparent meanings of the charters, and suggests that this is because it is also more likely to relate to a richer conception of the broader medieval world in which these charters were created than text-oriented work does. Finally, drawing on recent work on the ChartEx project, it explores how a combined approach, that takes the best of both text-markup and structured data modelling techniques, could evolve in the future. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2017.0184", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 6, 9]], "date-time": "2017-06-09T12:57:18Z", "timestamp": 1497013038000}, "page": "136-154", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Exploring a Model for the Semantics of Medieval Legal Charters"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "13", "author": [{"given": "John", "family": "Bradley", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Dauvit", "family": "Broun", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Alice", "family": "Rio", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Matthew", "family": "Hammond", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 16]], "date-time": "2019-10-16T14:29:53Z", "timestamp": 1571236193000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2017.0184"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2017.0184", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 26]], "date-time": "2019-11-26T18:34:20Z", "timestamp": 1574793260106}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Germany, 1935: the engineer Konrad Zuse (1910\u20131995), in the living room of his Berlin house, devotes himself to the design and construction of a binary, programmable machine, the Z1, capable of processing data in a fast and efficient way.

Rather, they are examples of a media practice indicating the tension between orality, handwriting, and printed books, especially since both the oral lecture course and the individual notes represent processes of transmitting and storing knowledge in which the text that is being explained does not even play a central role. We may compare them to modern, frequently collaborative practices that pursue aims going beyond straightforward models of text explication, which may help us develop more precise descriptions as well as a deeper understanding of the hermeneutics of textual annotation. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2017.0192", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10, 17]], "date-time": "2017-10-17T13:18:25Z", "timestamp": 1508246305000}, "page": "199-211", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Annotation Between Formation And Information"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "J\u00fcrgen", "family": "Leonhardt", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T17:18:55Z", "timestamp": 1566494335000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2017.0192"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2017.0192", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T09:45:19Z", "timestamp": 1574847919972}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditional historico-critical music editions provide scholars and musicians with an edited score based on the interpretation of various sources such as the composer's autograph(s), letters and other materials from copyists or publishers. Their digital counterparts have the potential to offer new and more expanded ways to explore the work. This is based on the possibility to provide large amounts of source materials and to annotate more extensively (since printing costs are irrelevant). Furthermore, audio and video recordings of performances can be integrated. But, similarly important, the user interface makes it much easier to navigate in the complex network of cross-references between various source materials and the editor's annotations. The XML-based Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) format is the standard music representation format for digital music editions. In this article we discuss current MEI-based annotation practices and outline the current challenges for music annotations, including a discussion of anchoring options, the embedding of addressable elements in the local musical context, the annotation of audio, and the categorisation of annotations. This leads to a discussion of open questions such as the ability to secure authorship in open and reusable editions. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2017.0195", "type": "journal-article", "created":

A Heroic Poem (1728), Dunciad Variorum (1729) and Dunciad in Four Books (1743) foreground the modelling and critique of different modes of annotation: elements of the commentary are attributed to a variety of fictitious, fictionalised or actually existing annotators, and the shaping of the material is significantly engaged with questions of print technology and mise-en-page. This paper analyses the techniques by which Pope deploys annotation as part of the work's oppositional rhetoric, and argues that, in the hands of his authorised editor Warburton, this approach gave rise to annotation that worked against the long-term interests of the poem and its author. The essay concludes by drawing out some possible implications for the practice of digital annotation. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2017.0191", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10, 17]], "date-time": "2017-10-17T13:18:25Z", "timestamp": 1508246305000}, "page": "174-198", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Interpretation, Agency, Entropy: Annotating Pope's Dunciads"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "Valerie", "family": "Rumbold", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T17:18:54Z", "timestamp": 1566494334000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2017.0191"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2017.0191", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T09:45:20Z", "timestamp": 1574847920065}, "reference-count": 65, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2017, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This contribution reflects on the value of plurality in the \u2018network with a thousand entrances\u2019 suggested by McCarty ( http://goo.gl/H3HAfs ), and others, in association with approaching time-honoured annotative and commentary practices of much-engaged texts.

With the burgeoning availability of newspapers in digital format, there is a pressing need to look at how we might effectively and efficiently use these digital resources to help answer research questions and add to key historical and geographical debates. Focusing on the analysis of a large digital corpus, this paper has two key foci: (I) to apply an innovative digital methodology, that combines corpus linguistics and geospatial technologies, to a very large corpus of newspaper texts and; (II) apply said methodology to a case study assessing the presentation of health and disease in a nineteenth-century newspaper. The paper illustrates that by linking existing techniques with new and innovative approaches it is possible to temporally and spatially analyse and map themes of interest in large digital corpora on a scale not possible through more traditional close reading methods. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0222", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10, 22]], "date-time": "2018-10-22T15:33:40Z", "timestamp": 1540222420000}, "page": "196-216", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Space and Time in 100 Million Words: Health and Disease in a Nineteenth-century Newspaper"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "Catherine", "family": "Porter", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Paul", "family": "Atkinson", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ian N.", "family": "Gregory", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T16:33:38Z", "timestamp": 1566491618000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0222"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0222", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T21:43:34Z", "timestamp": 1574891014245}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0223", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10, 22]], "date-time": "2018-10-22T15:33:40Z", "timestamp": 1540222420000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Back matter"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T16:33:39Z", "timestamp": 1566491619000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0223"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0223", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}], "article-number": "ijhac.2018.0223"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T21:43:34Z", "timestamp": 1574891014253}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This article joins calls for literary scholarship to move beyond the limitations of binary oppositions between \u2018close\u2019 and \u2018distant\u2019 reading and towards the development of approaches that exploit the macroanalytic potential of digital methods alongside the nuanced analysis that characterises literary scholarship. Drawing on a customised corpus of writing about the English Lake District, we model the application of a multiscalar approach known as geographical text analysis (GTA), which combines aspects of close reading and distant reading, and, in doing so, introduces a new method for literary research. Here, we focus on historical descriptions of the Lake District's soundscape to demonstrate both how perceptions of sound changed over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and how multi-scalar methods can uniquely uncover such historical-literary shifts. Sound, we argue, offers a particularly useful focus since it allows us to draw fruitful parallels between our methods and those applied by the writers we study. In this way, this article advocates for digital humanities scholarship that advances our disciplines in conversation with appropriate historical modes. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0220", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10, 22]], "date-time": "2018-10-22T15:33:40Z", "timestamp": 1540222420000}, "page": "163-182", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 4, "title": ["Combining Close and Distant Reading: A Multiscalar Analysis of the English Lake District's Historical Soundscape"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "Joanna E.", "family": "Taylor", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Ian N.", "family": "Gregory", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Christopher", "family": "Donaldson", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T16:33:35Z", "timestamp": 1566491615000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0220"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0220", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T21:43:36Z", "timestamp": 1574891016216}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0213", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10, 22]], "date-time": "2018-10-22T15:33:40Z", "timestamp": 1540222420000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Front matter"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T16:33:26Z", "timestamp": 1566491606000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0213"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0213", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}], "article-number": "ijhac.2018.0213"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T21:43:36Z", "timestamp": 1574891016216}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents the technical characteristics of the Belgian STREAM-project (2015\u20132019).

In contrast to modern datasets where tabulated and structured data usually correspond neatly to fixed boundary units, primary historical source materials occur in predominantly unstructured text format. In these instances, people, events, and places must be unraveled from handwritten scripts and, if possible, subsequently linked and coupled to some form of mapping. In this paper, a database solution to handling primary source material is discussed that enables the original text and its translation to be ingested into the system and for people, familial relations, events, and images to be linked and queried in real time. In particular, the system connects these databases via toponyms to a tightly coupled mapping interface. The system enables thesauri of people's names and places to be created on-the-fly and allows levels of confidence to be assigned by the investigator to these matches. Full database and toponymic search and linking capability is enabled. In addition, a mobile application supports investigation in the field to access details in the databases at the same time as ingesting additional data and information in real-time to the system. Through the use of this dynamic database coupling and union to a map interface it is proposed that the system provides a powerful platform for use with primary unstructured source material and contributes to a deeper mapping and understanding of historical place. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0218", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10, 22]], "date-time": "2018-10-22T15:33:40Z", "timestamp": 1540222420000}, "page": "120-137", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Deepening Historical GIS: An Integrated Database Solution for Linking People, Place and Events through Unstructured Text"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "Jim", "family": "Schindling", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Trevor M.", "family": "Harris", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T16:33:32Z", "timestamp": 1566491612000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0218"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0218", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T21:43:36Z", "timestamp": 1574891016219}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0215", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10, 22]], "date-time": "2018-10-22T15:33:40Z", "timestamp": 1540222420000}, "page": "vii-x", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Notes on Contributors"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T16:33:28Z", "timestamp": 1566491608000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0215"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0215", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T21:43:36Z", "timestamp": 1574891016250}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0214", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10, 22]], "date-time": "2018-10-22T15:33:40Z", "timestamp": 1540222420000}, "page": "v-vi", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Editors' Note"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T16:33:27Z", "timestamp": 1566491607000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0214"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0214", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 11, 27]], "date-time": "2019-11-27T21:43:41Z", "timestamp": 1574891021590}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> For three years now, a research group at the University of Santiago de Compostela has been working on the creation of literary maps of Compostela. <jats:sup>1</jats:sup> In this application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to literature, with the focus on a city of remarkable symbolic relevance, problems emerged, mainly concerning the mappeability of uncertainty and the codification of recurrence and emotions.

In this paper, we will compare literary maps of Santiago obtained on the one hand from the database created with the \u2018Estudiantina\u2019 and, on the other, from the database of 40 texts written by current students. Taking the maps as a point of departure, we will reflect on the historical changes in the imaginary of the city and the way it is perceived, inhabited and lived by current students. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0221", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 10, 22]], "date-time": "2018-10-22T15:33:40Z", "timestamp": 1540222420000}, "page": "183-195", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["The Use of GIS to Draw Literary Maps of Compostela.

Xuejia Tzu-chi Temple in Taiwan, an ancestral temple that inherited the traditional belief of Bao Sheng Da Di ([Formula: see text], God of medicine) from Baijiao ([Formula: see text]), holds much religious significance and is crucial to the residents' spiritual sustenance and community. Among those objects preserved in this temple are the intricate Ye Wang's Koji potteries as well as various other precious cultural relics, making the palace an important research base for Taiwan's traditional arts. As such, religion, society, art and other elements coalesce to form the unique spirit of place of the Tzu-chi Temple. This study, under the principle of continuity in space, focuses on the temple square, corridors spanning different areas, the pantheon, and uses \u2018image-based interactive panoramic imaging technology\u2019 to capture a total of 45 spatial scenes, recording the overall spatial construct and the paths within which the space could move, completing the spirit of space of the object, and recording the track of space. Then setting this as the basis for establishing a recording of various activities of the humanities and for preserving the spirit of place of the Xuejia Tzu-chi Temple for future generations, we hope that the results of this study will provide various relevant types of digital recording for research on spatial construct in monuments. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2013.0067", "type":

This type of placename started to be used during the Japanese colonisation of Taiwan (1895\u20131945) and replaced placenames, that referred to regions where migration to Taiwan had started generations ago. The questions raised by the t\u00e1ngh\u00e0o concern its function and meaning in a constantly renegotiated and redefined society. Why was a mythological placename adopted and how could this placename survive changes in regimes and burial practices? The framework we adopt for our analysis is that of Digital Anthropology (DA), using an archive of approximately 35.000 digitised tombstones plus digitised segments of statal discourse. The first puzzle parts of this investigation hint to an extremely diversified, non-orchestrated onset of the new practice.

Not only the traditional Oriental watercolour paintings but also the ancient Chinese porcelains show a great deal of interesting colours that have been archived by digital camera in digital archive practice. However, the majority of the current digital cameras operate with RGB filters, which record every pixel in a tri-chromatic manner. There are several limitations for such a tri-chromatic camera. One is that it describes the colour of the object only by three primary colours. Another is that the image captured is strongly influenced by the illumination at the scene, such that the archived image appears as it does specifically under that lighting condition, not as the original object itself. With such limitations, a problem called \u2018metamerism\u2019 may occur when an object is viewed under different illuminations.

With consequent analysis and process, art works can be archived with high precision spectral data with the advantages of resolving the issue of metamerism and of reproducing the art work under any kind of illumination.

Most of the tools are computer-based applications with a screen-based interface to provide multimedia learning environment. However, many students still prefer using paper materials especially for reading activities because of many familiar experiences of learning with a pen and paper. Also, many studies indicate that paper still plays an important role especially in reading activities. For addressing the issue, a paper-based digital pen with digital functions is used in paper materials for assisting in reading, and a novel fluency intervention program is designed in the hope of being easily and fully incorporated into regular classrooms for helping students achieve reading fluency. An actual study incorporating this fluency program was carried out in an English course in a regular EFL classroom in Taiwan. During the course, students were able to use the digital pen to interact paper materials for one-on-one digital support, including playing a model of fluent reading, recording their independent practice and playing back such recordings for confirmation. Thereby, the students required minimum behavior changes during learning and were able to have significant opportunities to practice each major component of fluency program in a comfortable and assisted way and thus to improve their reading fluency. Because of the intervention program being new to the teacher and students, the repertory grid technique was further applied as a tool for eliciting precise understanding of the students\u2019 preferences toward the program. Finally, the teacher was able to give suggestions and advices to the students during the learning activities and thus this approach effectively helped the students make substantial gains in reading fluency. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2013.0073", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 2, 15]], "date-time": "2013-02-15T11:39:47Z", "timestamp": 1360928387000}, "page": "234-246", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["Using a Paper-based Digital Pen for Supporting English Courses in Regular Classrooms to Improve Reading Fluency"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Chia-Chen", "family": "Tan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Chih-Ming", "family": "Chen", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Hahn-Ming", "family": "Lee", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T14:46:13Z", "timestamp": 1566485173000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 3]]}, "issue": "supplement"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2013.0073"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2013.0073", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 1]], "date-time": "2019-12-01T06:47:28Z", "timestamp": 1575182848924}, "reference-count": 9, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "supplement", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Distinguished anthropologist Michael Moerman's donation of his ethnographic fieldwork materials in 2005 to the Anthropological Archives of the Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Anthropology Centre (SAC) posed new and compelling questions to the SAC's archival management staff. They have sought to strike a balance between the academic needs of users and the ethical and legal considerations in the management and distribution of tangible and intangible cultural property from the source communities where Moerman did his research. Endeavouring to develop a protocol for the management of an ethnographic archival database, the SAC is aware of its obligation to build awareness of the cultural rights of the source community as the rightful owners of this cultural property. By incorporating the views of multiple stakeholders in a previously binary division of materials as \u2018sensitive\u2019 or \u2018non-sensitive\u2019, it is trying to take into account a diversity of views about access to these cultural materials. One aim of our research was, thus, to highlight the role of the archivists themselves by asking them to review and question their own processes and contributions to the management of anthropological archives. </jats:p><jats:p> We expect that the conclusions and observations drawn from this study will be used to create a SAC protocol for cultural information management and distribution. Though the Tai Lue source community that Moerman studied in the 1960s does not have a pre-existing cultural protocol to determine the parameters surrounding digital repatriation and access, the community's opinions and reflections will be fully considered in the creation of the SAC protocol for use as an initial guideline. Thus, the second aim of our research was to elicit and examine the community's reactions to ethnographic material deriving from it, in order to highlight the issue of a community's collective right to be involved in preservation of and access to such material. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2013.0063", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 2, 15]], "date-time": "2013-02-15T11:39:47Z", "timestamp": 1360928387000}, "page": "100-110", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Ethics, Access, and Rights in Anthropological Archive Management: A Case Study from Thailand"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Thanwadee", "family": "Sookprasert", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Sittisak", "family": "Rungcharoensuksri", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "reference": [{"issue": "6", "key": "b1-1", "first-page": "18", "volume": "21", "author": "Brown Michael F.", "year": "1998", "journal-title": "Cultural Resource Management"}, {"key": "b2", "DOI": "10.1515/9781400833047-009", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b3", "author": "Buchanan Elizabeth A.", "first-page": "221", "year": "2002", "volume-title": "Libraries, Museums, and Archives: Legal Issues and Ethical Challenges in the New Information Era"}, {"key": "b4", "author": "Lipinski Tomas A.", "first-page": "47", "year": "2002", "volume-title": "Libraries, Museums, and Archives: Legal Issues and Ethical Challenges in the New Information Era"}, {"key": "b5", "author": "Moerman Michael.", "year": "1968", "volume-title": "Agricultural Change and Peasant Choice in a Thai Village"}, {"key": "b6", "author": "Schwarz Judith.", "first-page": "82", "year": "2005", "volume-title": "Privacy and Confidentiality Perspectives: Archivists and Archival Records"}, {"key": "b7", "author": "Silverman Helaine", "first-page": "3", "year": "2008", "volume-title": "Cultural Heritage and Human Rights"}, {"key": "b8", "author": "Wilson Richard A.", "first-page": "1", "year": "1997", "volume-title": "Human Rights, Culture and Context: Anthropological Perspectives"}, {"key": "b2-1", "author": "Koch Grace", "first-page": "170", "year": "2004", "volume-title": "Archives for the Future: Global Perspectives on Audiovisual Archives in the 21st Century"}], "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T14:46:00Z", "timestamp": 1566485160000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 3]]}, "references-count": 9, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 3]]}, "issue": "supplement"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2013.0063"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2013.0063", "relation": {"cites": []}, "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 1]], "date-time": "2019-12-01T06:47:28Z", "timestamp": 1575182848969}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "supplement", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> We have developed a software platform for converting the Chinese classics into a digital format which the original layout is preserved.

students encounter in such courses. These difficulties arise due to the extremely full itineraries that the course structure may seek to provide, which can become overly burdensome to students in terms of what they are able to process fully, and what they retain during the course and after the course is over. One avenue of possible amelioration of this difficulty, while not challenging the opportunity to expose students to a wide range of sites and course-topical material, is a reliance on mapping. In terms of pre-travel, the map serves as orientation, a setting of expectations for what will be seen. During the course, while onsite, students are able to use the supplemental materials offered on the interactive map better to understand their surroundings. After the course, revisiting the map, along with their course notes, photos, and journals, provides an essential aide-m\u00e9moire. Choosing potential sites for extensive mapping based on those sites students are least familiar with is a way, then, to maximize the map's impact on learning outcomes. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0208", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3, 14]], "date-time": "2018-03-14T15:17:40Z", "timestamp": 1521040660000}, "page": "71-80", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Mapping as Orientation, Support, and Aide-m\u00e9moire in Short-term Travel Courses"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "Christopher M.", "family": "James", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T13:57:43Z", "timestamp": 1566482263000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0208"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0208", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 2]], "date-time": "2019-12-02T05:07:33Z", "timestamp": 1575263253110}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> High impact learning experiences hold forth great promise for enhancing the personal and intellectual development of students.

Due to the increasing popularity of walking the Camino overall, overcrowding and other related issues are becoming a problem. I propose that faculty leading student groups on the Camino incorporate digital mapping tools as part of the curriculum to increase awareness among students about the potential impact they may have on local communities. Furthermore, the use of digital mapping tools to either complement or replace the more traditionally assigned journal will help the student meet the desired learning outcomes set forth by the first year experience abroad program\u2014develop, experience and reflect.

Using a visiting special collection of rare books for students at a small college, the project approached hand-press era books in three phases: 1) a bibliographic description and transcription; 2) book forensics, and 3) a \u2018deep map\u2019 of a book. With mapping\u2014understood as an expression of spatial thinking\u2014as a guide, students recognized that the singular text, even the dialogic text, is far less remarkable than locating and articulating the links between history, place, literature, and culture. Students engaged with terminology (descriptive bibliography), recognized the temporal lines of the book as an object (provenance), followed the development of a book as a polyglotous intellectual entity, and reviewed the geographic/historical experiences of the author and of the book (biography, publishing). The spatial turn allowed students to construct (and in some cases, deconstruct) the cultural world in which texts, authors and printers collide. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0205", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3, 14]], "date-time": "2018-03-14T15:17:40Z", "timestamp": 1521040660000}, "page": "37-47", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["\u2018Books are not absolutely dead things\u2019: English Literature, Material Culture and Mapping Text"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "Catherine R.", "family": "Eskin", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T13:57:41Z", "timestamp": 1566482261000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0205"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0205", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 2]], "date-time": "2019-12-02T05:07:33Z", "timestamp": 1575263253177}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> A central challenge in short-term study abroad programs is making sure that students have meaningful interactions with people abroad, something that scholarship has shown to be tremendously beneficial, both for linguistic gains and for cross-cultural exchange. This article examines the potential benefits of collaborative mapping for encouraging student interaction with local residents, while also considering the value of spatial analysis to the interdisciplinary aims of a course centered on theatre and French Studies. One author is a cultural anthropologist and professor of French, and the other is a professor of theatre. The course explores theatre as a window into French society and culture in three distinct geographic settings (Avignon and the rural Vaucluse, Marseille, and Paris). Space is important to its study of theatrical literature, of theatrical form and site-specific performance, and of the varied meanings of theatre to people living in diverse social environments, including rural settings and neighborhoods in urban centers and peripheries. Written prior to implementing the project for the 2017 version of the course, this article examines a mapping project intended to fully exploit the opportunities of study abroad for student engagement with other perspectives abroad, and for inter-disciplinary dialogue and exchange. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2018.0202", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3, 14]], "date-time": "2018-03-14T15:17:40Z", "timestamp": 1521040660000}, "page": "5-14", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Collaborative Mapping to Enhance Local Engagement and Interdisciplinary Dialogue in a Short-term Study Abroad Program"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "Rebecca", "family": "Free", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Mark", "family": "Ingram", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T13:57:36Z", "timestamp": 1566482256000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2018.0202"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2018.0202", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 2]], "date-time": "2019-12-02T05:07:33Z", "timestamp": 1575263253191}, "reference-count": 5, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> While the humanities embraced the value of spatial analysis some time ago; political science has yet to marry traditional social science methods with the visual and interactive process of mapping.

reflects on what research infrastructures are, suggesting that there are two dominant themes\u2009\u2013\u2009one arising from the funding bodies postulating that research infrastructure development offers unprecedented opportunities to drive forward that which is new, which is innovative, and which drives competition and success; the other which suggests that infrastructure is subordinate, a substrate that supports the real work of research, and which becomes a thing that shifts into the background and is invisible. This paper argues that neither of these positions is wholly true or particularly helpful as we move to invest significant sums of money in digital research infrastructures. Instead, I propose that we need to view infrastructure as a material and experiential presence that is embedded in the practices and experience of research, which builds on and enhances that which already exists, that unites scholars with archivists, librarians, and museum curators, and that also finds a place for the amateur. Finally, and most importantly, I wish to argue that we must foreground the \u2018research\u2019 in \u2018research infrastructures\u2019. concentrating less on the component parts of infrastructure and instead focusing on its relationship to research practices. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2013.0078", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 1]], "date-time": "2013-11-01T10:35:09Z", "timestamp": 1383302109000}, "page": "4-23", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 5, "title": ["What are Research Infrastructures?"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Sheila", "family": "Anderson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T15:43:56Z", "timestamp": 1566488636000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2013.0078"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2013.0078", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 3]], "date-time": "2019-12-03T15:50:31Z", "timestamp": 1575388231235}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> An interdisciplinary team of researchers were challenged to create a model of a deep map during a three-day charette at the NEH Institute on Spatial Narratives and Deep Maps.

Existing impacts from e-infrastructure are discussed, based largely on the authors\u2019 own discrete or collaborative projects. This paper argues that we need to consider further how digital resources are actually used, and the ways in which future digital resources might enable new types of research questions to be asked. It considers the potential for such enabling resources to advance digital humanities significantly in the near future. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2013.0079", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 1]], "date-time": "2013-11-01T10:35:09Z", "timestamp": 1383302109000}, "page": "24-40", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["E-Infrastructure in the Humanities"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Paul S.", "family": "Ell", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Lorna M.", "family": "Hughes", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T15:43:57Z", "timestamp": 1566488637000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2013.0079"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2013.0079", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 3]], "date-time": "2019-12-03T15:50:31Z", "timestamp": 1575388231263}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This article offers a critique of the transfer of a technological-scientific paradigm of research infrastructure to the field of the humanities. This critique is informed by our experience of formulating user requirements for the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) project, and especially by a series of interviews we undertook with user-facing archivists working at EHRI partner institutions. We argue that the archival voices we recovered during these interviews articulate a range of concerns that clash with some of the major assumptions which frame current discussions about research infrastructure. In particular, we demonstrate that archival research is currently heavily mediated by archivists. And yet, inter-mediation is a theme that is insufficiently explored in recent theorising about research infrastructure. Contextualising our findings within some recent trends in archival science, we show that an infrastructure such as the EHRI must be build around the complex relationship between scholar, archivist and archive. We conclude by indicating how building infrastructures for humanities research may enable us to fruitfully re-conceptualise and re-energise this relationship by transposing it from the physical world to digital environments. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2013.0085", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 1]], "date-time": "2013-11-01T10:35:09Z", "timestamp": 1383302109000}, "page": "128-146", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 9, "title": ["The Missing Voice: Archivists and Infrastructures for Humanities Research"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Reto", "family": "Speck", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Petra", "family": "Links", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T15:44:04Z", "timestamp": 1566488644000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2013.0085"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2013.0085", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 3]], "date-time": "2019-12-03T15:50:31Z", "timestamp": 1575388231278}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> CLARIN is a recently-established research infrastructure which aims to build and sustain services based on language resources and tools.

The first declares tasks for the museum staff to perform while building and utilizing knowledge. The second abstracts content in consistent structures for reuse. The last comprises subsystems serving functionalities for knowledge-based content management.

In addition, a platform based on the framework is implemented to support knowledge-based content management, value-added application and service development, and business marketing.

The scientific data contained in a retracted paper should be erased from the data bank. Even after retraction, many of these papers continue to be cited or can re-appear in future literature citation after a number of years.

These flawed papers have high impact on public health and patient care as illustrated here by the cases of Wakefield and Potti.

E-activities may not only captivate participants and allow them to be immersed in friendly user interfaces, but also permit participants to engage in pre-task and online planning. Consequently, E-activities may enhance production performance in the complexity and accuracy dimensions, which were based on those described in previous studies. The other aspect was to observe the effects on the L2 production of learners according to the aforementioned computer-mediated communication (CMC) settings by manipulating task repetition. Whereas rehearsal can improve the performance of a task, it was also used to distinguish between the differences among tasks performed with the same partner or with a different partner. The theory of task-based language learning and teaching (TBLT) was investigated to determine whether further modification or extension was needed in these CMC settings. The results of this study showed that task repetition enhanced the performance of learners regarding syntactic variety and lexical complexity. Task repetition had more positive effects on the changed-partner group than it had on the same-partner group. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2014.0109", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 2, 10]], "date-time": "2014-02-10T10:14:37Z", "timestamp": 1392027277000}, "page": "221-236", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 4, "title": ["Effects of Task Repetition on L2 Oral (in Written Form) Production in Computer-Mediated Communication"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Pao-Ling", "family": "Liao", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Kuoen", "family": "Fu", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T11:37:44Z", "timestamp": 1566473864000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 3]]}, "issue": "supplement"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2014.0109"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2014.0109", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T05:10:29Z", "timestamp": 1575436229683}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "supplement", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This programme aims to digitize video collections hosted by the Museum of Shadow Play of the Kaohsiung City Cultural Affairs Bureau in Taiwan.

This process has also been accelerated by the emergence of cultural portals including regional, national and thematic portals and the European cultural portal Europeana. The Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) sector also has the challenge of the complexity of the information itself. This is because of the relationship that each cultural object has with the collections it is part of, with the memory institutions where it is held, with the other objects of the same nature and/or culturally connected with it, and the many other types of relationships that represent the real scientific value of the digitised cultural object (be it a book, an archival record, an artefact from a museum, a sound recording or a video). Further, the investment in the production of the digital cultural heritage data is extremely high because the description of each object requires the human intervention of experts in the sector in order to associate the necessary metadata. Automatic extraction of knowledge (metadata) from the digital representation of cultural items is still far from being at a production level. It is not yet commonly available or seamless to the cultural institutions that are engaged in the digitisation of their collections. In addition to the DCH content that derive from digitisation processes applied to the tangible heritage, also born digital cultural heritage is more and more a reality, particularly in the artistic scenario. Plastic artists are commonly using 3D modelling for their studies. Architects, writers, multimedia artists, graphic designers and almost all other artistic expressions produce data that need to be preserved for the researchers of today and for the future generations. Digital cultural data is therefore extremely precious and its preservation is more and more an imperative priority. This paper intends to discuss these matters in the light of the ongoing work carried out by the DCH-RP project ( www.dch-rp.eu ) funded by the European Commission. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2014.0102", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 2, 10]], "date-time": "2014-02-10T10:14:37Z", "timestamp": 1392027277000}, "page": "107-123", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 4, "title": ["Digital Cultural Heritage Roadmap for Preservation"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Antonella", "family": "Fresa", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T11:37:32Z", "timestamp": 1566473852000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 3]]}, "issue": "supplement"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2014.0102"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2014.0102", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T05:10:30Z", "timestamp": 1575436230100}, "reference-count": 20, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "supplement", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we approach the paradigmatic changes in the inscriptions of Taiwan's tombstones not as statistic phenomenon, which can be traced on maps and timelines, but as phenomena that occurred in the history of individual families.

This project involved some aspects including teaching materials design specifically for online instruction, communication with schools and their teachers/students, teacher's training for synchronized online instruction, e-learning platform and facilities arrangement, and problem solving along the implementation process. The program has been implemented during the year of 2012. We have cooperative agreements with five schools districts in different states and have established a workable operation model for this international cooperation.

Confident in the capability of this technological advancement, the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education has mandated that by year 2015 all universities must have the capacity to deliver 30% of T&amp;L via e-learning. Significant resources are allocated to empower research and implementation towards the attainment of this aspiration. The choice of general physics at the pre-U level as the domain of e-learning appears promising. This paper presents the implementation of a suite of e-learning modules within the framework of blended learning for pre-U general physics. General physics at the pre-U level provides an important knowledge interface and linkage between high-school and university science curriculum. Success at this entrance level would pave the way to better knowledge attainment and dissemination at higher levels in subsequent years. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2014.0105", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 2, 10]], "date-time": "2014-02-10T10:14:37Z", "timestamp": 1392027277000}, "page": "167-178", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["e-Learning for College Physics: Bridging Knowledge Gap in Science"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Hock Lye", "family": "Koh", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Su Yean", "family": "Teh", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "reference": [{"key": "b1", "author": "Bransford J.C.", "first-page": "479", "year": "1987", "volume-title": "Dynamic assessment: An interactional approach to evaluating learning potential"}, {"key": "b2", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.001", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b3", "DOI": "10.1111/1468-2273.00163", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b4", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compedu.2011.08.003", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b5", "DOI": "10.1080/00140130050201427", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b6", "DOI": "10.2304/elea.2008.5.3.275", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b7", "DOI": "10.1016/j.csi.2011.08.006", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b8", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compedu.2009.06.014", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b9", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chb.2006.02.002", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b10", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compedu.2005.10.011", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b11", "DOI": "10.1016/j.iheduc.2010.09.004", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b12", "author": "Sims J.V.R.", "volume": "22", "year": "2005", "journal-title": "Communications of the Association for Information Systems"}, {"key": "b13", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ejrad.2012.11.034", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b14", "DOI": "10.1016/j.im.2008.08.003", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b15", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compedu.2009.11.001", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b16", "DOI": "10.1016/j.phpro.2012.02.302", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b17", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.012", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}], "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T11:37:39Z", "timestamp": 1566473859000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 3]]}, "references-count": 17, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 3]]}, "issue": "supplement"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2014.0105"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2014.0105", "relation": {"cites": []}, "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T12:34:31Z", "timestamp": 1575462871042}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports from the perspective of a historian who is investigating an early medieval manuscript, aiming at opening it up for further research and exploring its location in space, time, and intellectual context. The manuscript in question and the texts it carries show a complex, interwoven network of intra- and intertextual relations and the paper argues that only a combination, provided by computational means as the methodological key, of two usually distinct research approaches, namely close reading and distant reading, can deliver answers to the research questions imposed. The paper introduces some central methods of an interdisciplinary field, commonly known as digital humanities, in the realm of data representation (data modeling and text encoding) as well as core applications in the realm of data presentation and analysis (digital editing and visualization). As these supportive methods are neither the starting-point for historical research nor an end-in-itself, they are mirrored against scholarly practices of both, of the early Middle Ages and of modern scholarship. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2014.0121", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4, 9]], "date-time": "2014-04-09T09:20:58Z", "timestamp": 1397035258000}, "page": "81-105", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["From the Scholarly Edition to Visualization: Re-using Encoded Data for Historical Research"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Malte", "family": "Rehbein", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T14:16:45Z", "timestamp": 1566483405000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2014.0121"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2014.0121", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T12:34:31Z", "timestamp": 1575462871052}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> It is time to make a critical appraisal of the application of the Geographic Information System (GIS) to historical research. In this article I briefly review the promises and achievements of the use of this technology in history and I also consider some of its possible developments.

In the last section, the new avenues opened by GIS to historical research and the difficulties that its application also involves are considered in the light of the evolution of historiography and of the experience of using databases in history. I argue that although the application of this tool in historical research represented an important innovation, GIS did not bring about a revolution in knowledge production in history. I also raise doubts about the notion of a spatial turn in this field. I finally suggest that the emphasis should be put, not on the technology, but on the historical problems. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2014.0118", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4, 9]], "date-time": "2014-04-09T09:20:58Z", "timestamp": 1397035258000}, "page": "28-45", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["Geographic Information Systems and Historical Research: An Appraisal"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Lu\u00eds Espinha", "family": "da Silveira", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T14:16:41Z", "timestamp": 1566483401000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2014.0118"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2014.0118", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 4]], "date-time": "2019-12-04T12:34:31Z", "timestamp": 1575462871072}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 4]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> The web is the primary means of communication in developed societies.

While Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are widely used as a means of visualizing and exploring material in the spatial humanities, GIS technology is acknowledged to be ill-suited to information that is vague, uncertain, ambiguous, imprecise or having other qualities that in a scientific setting could be regarded as imperfections. In the humanities such \u2018imperfections\u2019 are of course important, and qualitative spatial relations are one source of data that challenges scientifically based GIS. This article reviews the origin of qualitative spatial reasoning and representation in A. N.

Qualitative representation is applicable to modelling spatial arrangements in many domains, not just geographical space.

place names (toponyms) from texts and using them to conduct analyses of the geographies within the texts are becoming reasonably well established. These are generally referred to as Geographical Text Analysis (GTA) and allow us to ask questions about the geographies within a corpus. The limitation of this approach is that the geographies that can be uncovered are solely associated with toponyms for which a coordinate-based location can be assigned. While this method is valuable, it is effectively a quantitative representation of the geographies associated with named places. Other representations of geography are ignored. To complement GTA, we need to develop techniques that are capable of representing the more qualitative representations of geography that are found within texts. Drawing on the Corpus of Lake District Writing, this paper presents some initial ideas about how this can be achieved, primarily by using techniques from corpus linguistics. </jats:p>", "DOI":

Because it is radically interactive and can permit viewers or listeners to modify a work directly by means of their cerebral activity, such art illuminates the role of audience members in shaping that work's meaning; in this way, it literalizes reader-response theory and allows the public to engage even with opaque or alienating pieces. BCI-based art also reframes the significance of the artist's intentions, prompting a reconsideration of the truism that \u2018the author is dead\u2019, both by positing a collective form of authorship and by granting a creator access to her own unconscious impulses. Finally, via the notion that it may be possible to transfer unfiltered ideas between brains, BCI-inspired artworks provide a new perspective on art as mediation. Although artists have traditionally been praised for seeming to grant direct access to their emotions, one could argue that artistry happens in the act of concretizing and externalizing one's ideas \u2013 that is, in the mediated translation of thought rather than in thought itself.

Using an example drawn from the vast archives of post-war interviews with Holocaust survivors, it draws on approaches developed in Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) to explore how two key spatial aspects of survivor's narratives \u2013 their uncertain wartime trajectories and the slippage in scales as these are retold \u2013 can be represented. Spatial information in narratives tends to not provide the exact coordinates necessary to store the information in geospatial databases. Instead, narratives rely much more on often less precise qualitative spatial relations such as \u2018near\u2019, \u2018next to\u2019, \u2018at the corner of\u2019 without precise geometric interpretations. Given that relational databases are ill-equipped to store this kind of relational spatial knowledge from natural language sources, the article argues for a need for digital humanists to return to first principles and reconsider database design. Descriptive triple-based graph representations, which have been devised to accommodate this kind of highly irregular, semi-structured relational knowledge, have the potential to work with, rather than against, the grain of the narrative sources that underlie the work of much of the digital humanities.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2019.0230", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 10, 16]], "date-time": "2019-10-16T14:29:48Z", "timestamp": 1571236188000}, "page": "39-52", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Geographies of the Holocaust: Experiments in GIS, QSR, and Graph Representations"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "13", "author": [{"given": "Tim", "family": "Cole", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Torsten", "family": "Hahmann", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "reference": [{"key": "b1", "DOI": "10.1007/978-94-017-9960-7_9", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b2", "DOI": "10.1080/00045608.2011.653732", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b3", "DOI": "10.1016/0260-9827(87)90002-4", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b4", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1931-0846.2009.tb00447.x", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b5", "author": "Bodenhamer David J.", "year": "2010", "volume-title": "The Spatial Humanities: GIS and the Future of Humanities Scholarship"}, {"key": "b7", "author": "Casati Roberto", "year": "1999", "volume-title": "Parts and Places"}, {"key": "b8", "DOI": "10.1057/9780230524507_11", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b9", "DOI": "10.1305/ndjfl/1093883455", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b10", "DOI": "10.1016/0962-6298(96)00027-3", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"issue": "3", "key": "b11", "first-page": "149", "volume": "3", "author": "Clementini Eliseo", "year": "1995", "journal-title": "Information Sciences"}, {"key": "b12", "DOI": "10.1007/3-540-56869-7_16", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b13", "DOI": "10.1016/0020-0255(95)00289-8", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b14", "DOI": "10.1145/362384.362685", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b15", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1009712514511", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"issue": "4", "key": "b16", "first-page": "357", "volume": "32", "author": "Cohn Anthony G.", "year": "2003", "journal-title": "Journal of Symbolic Logic"}, {"key": "b17", "DOI": "10.1006/jhge.1995.0021", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b18", "author": "Cole Tim", "year": "2003", "volume-title": "Holocaust City.

We argue that instead of trying to explain knowledge exchange in Early Modern Europe by focusing on The Republic of Letters as one entity consisting of scholars , it might be more useful to reconstruct the spatial distribution of actors and of (non-)textual documents in virtual networks of knowledge.

This scholarship has examined how European sources (both texts and maps) have denied indigenous history, omitted indigenous presence, elided indigenous agency, and ignored indigenous spaces all while exaggerating their own power and importance. These works provide examples of colonial authors performing these erasures, often as a means to dispossess. What they lack, however, is a systematic means of identifying, locating, and measuring these silences in space and time. This article proposes a spatial history methodology which can make visible, as well as measurable and quantifiable the ways in which indigenous people and spaces have been erased by colonial narratives. It presents two methods for doing this. First, narrative analysis and geovisualization are used to deconstruct the imperial histories found in colonial European sources. Second it combines text with maps to tell a new (spatial) narrative of conquest. This new narrative reconstructs indigenous activity through a variety of digital maps, including \u2018mood maps\u2019, indigenous activity maps, and maps of indigenous aid. The resulting spatial narrative shows the Spanish conquest of Peru was never inevitable and was dependent on the constant aid of immense numbers of indigenous people. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2017.0177", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 3, 7]], "date-time": "2017-03-07T10:32:23Z", "timestamp": 1488882743000}, "page": "39-54", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 2, "title": ["Peering Beyond the Imperial Gaze: Using Digital Tools to Construct a Spatial History of Conquest"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "11", "author": [{"given": "Jeremy M.", "family": "Mikecz", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T13:12:27Z", "timestamp": 1566479547000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2017, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2017.0177"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2017.0177", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 24]], "date-time": "2020-02-24T08:03:20Z", "timestamp": 1582531400305}, "reference-count": 43, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2008, 10]]}, "DOI": "10.3366/e1753854809000305", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2009, 9, 17]], "date-time": "2009-09-17T10:59:27Z", "timestamp": 1253185167000}, "page": "39-62", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 14, "title": ["Making Sense of Strange Sounds: (Mutual) Intelligibility of Related Language Varieties.

For this shift to take place, two things must be demonstrated: first, that it is technically possible to create a useful GIS of textual material, the main medium through which humanities research is conducted; and, secondly that such a database can be used to enhance our understanding of disciplines within the humanities. This paper reports on a pilot project that created a GIS of two textual accounts of tours of the Lake District: Thomas Gray's 1769 excursion and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's self-styled \u2018circumcursion\u2019 of 1802. It describes how these accounts were converted into a GIS and explores various methodologies that can then be used to explore the spatialities embedded within their respective tours. The resulting material has been placed on the Internet at http://www.lancs.ac.uk/mappingthelakes . The pilot demonstrates that it is both possible, and conceptually fruitful, to move GIS beyond the quantitative arena in which it currently resides and into more qualitative areas of humanities research. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2009.0009", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2010, 6, 9]], "date-time": "2010-06-09T13:02:57Z", "timestamp": 1276088577000}, "page": "61-84", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 9, "title": ["Thomas Gray, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and geographical information systems: A literary GIS of two Lake District tours"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Ian N.", "family": "Gregory", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "David", "family": "Cooper", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T12:38:29Z", "timestamp": 1566477509000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2009, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2009.0009"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2009.0009", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 7]], "date-time": "2020-02-07T19:44:32Z", "timestamp": 1581104672336}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "supplement", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital technology has profoundly altered nearly every aspect of our lives.

The discourse quality index was modified by incorporating an item into the index that detected the presence and magnitude of a spatial precision construct.

Yet a straightforward binary pitting sealed roads as \u2018good\u2019 vs unsealed roads as \u2018bad\u2019 was challenged in subsequent qualitative interviews with long-time residents. Instead, a range of opinions emerged about the role that differing road surfaces played in everyday and historic mobilities. A fuller picture of the motivations and cultural associations of bitumen vs dirt road driving resulted from deploying humanities research methods of interviewing and discourse analysis. Such an approach revealed preferences and motivations that sometimes challenged inferences gained from mapping results alone. There are limits then in relying solely on historical cartographic data to produce maps and spatial representations and existing humanities techniques may hold, in some instances, greater explanatory power. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2015.0151", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 10, 16]], "date-time": "2015-10-16T08:07:44Z", "timestamp": 1444982864000}, "page": "242-261", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 3, "title": ["Maps and Mobilities: On the Possibilities and Limits of Spatial Technologies for Humanities Research"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "9", "author": [{"given": "Chris", "family": "Brennan-Horley", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T17:22:29Z", "timestamp": 1566494549000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2015, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2015.0151"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2015.0151", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 26]], "date-time": "2020-02-26T16:23:29Z", "timestamp": 1582734209571}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> New data sources, for example in the form of geotagged image libraries and digitised archives of historical text documents, provide us with new opportunities for exploring how place is described. Using a framework derived from work in human geography and information science, we illustrate how there is more to place than names and coordinates. Through a set of case studies we explore different aspects of the seemingly trivial query \u2018mountains in the Alps\u2019 addressing a range of issues including ambiguity, the use of vernacular names, ways in which concepts such as mountain are used in different locations and by different groups, approaches to automatically generating macro-maps in space and time and, finally, techniques allowing regions to be characterised and compared based on the terms used to describe them. The use of all these methods in combination allows us to come closer to a meaningful representation of place in the sense of human geography within the context of Geographic Information Science. However, our approaches focus on the naming of places and their material or perceivable properties, and there is still much work to do to properly represent place, and particularly sense of place. Nonetheless, we suggest that such approaches have considerable potential for those working in the digital humanities, and especially those concerned with contributing to a spatial turn therein. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2015.0139", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3, 4]], "date-time": "2015-03-04T08:37:04Z", "timestamp": 1425458224000}, "page": "74-94", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 14, "title": ["From Space to Place: Place-Based Explorations of Text"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "9", "author": [{"given": "Ross S.", "family": "Purves", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Curdin", "family": "Derungs", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T11:28:42Z", "timestamp": 1566473322000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2015, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2015.0139"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2015.0139", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 26]], "date-time": "2020-02-26T16:40:25Z", "timestamp": 1582735225230}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we introduce a web GIS platform created expressly for exploring and researching a set of 63,467 historical maps and illustrations extracted from 4,000 titles of Chinese local gazetteers.

By bringing together historical illustrations depicting spatial configurations of localities and the earliest modern cartographic maps, researchers of Chinese history can study the different spatial epistemologies represented in both collections. We report our workflow for creating this web GIS platform, starting from identifying and extracting visual materials from local gazetteers, tagging them with keywords and categories to facilitate content search, to georeferencing them based on their source locations. We also experimented with neural networks to train a tagger with positive results. Finally, we display them in the web GIS platform with two modes, Images in Map (IIM) and Maps in Map (MIM), and with content- and location-based filtering. These features together enable researchers easy and quick exploration and comparison of these two large sets of geospatial and visual materials of China. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2020.0246", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 26]], "date-time": "2020-02-26T16:08:35Z", "timestamp": 1582733315000}, "page": "81-97", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Displaying Spatial Epistemologies on Web GIS: Using Visual Materials from the Chinese Local Gazetteers as an Example"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "14", "author": [{"given": "Nung-yao", "family": "Lin", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Shih-pei", "family": "Chen", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Sean", "family": "Wang", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Calvin", "family": "Yeh", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 26]], "date-time": "2020-02-26T16:08:37Z", "timestamp": 1582733317000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2020.0246"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2020.0246", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 26]], "date-time": "2020-02-26T16:40:25Z", "timestamp": 1582735225269}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> This research introduces a novel geo-spatial sampling model to overcome a major difficulty in historical economic geography of Bulgarian lands during a crucial period: immediately before and after the de facto independence of the territory from the Ottoman Empire in the second half of the nineteenth century.

McMurtry's perspective provides an Anglo-European eye, influenced by Cervantean Iberian literary tropes on the transformation of the West from indigenous and Spanish trails to American rail-road tracks. The LA Noirscapes map phenomenologically illustrates how the location of novel settings cluster in contiguous and convergent places on a street grid palimpsest of Los Angeles between 1949 and 1997. Employing HumGIS methods, this essay considers the marriage of empirical cartography and impressionistic topography; the former concerned with latitude, longitude and space, the latter with plotting literary, historical and cultural perceptions and experiences of place. By engaging the concept of Euclidian space with the phenomenology of place, geographers can contextualize field work, and other methods with literary, cartographical and GIS analysis to uncover the means to craft new avenues to study the dynamic and symbiotic formations of historical landscapes, identities, senses of place and location. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2020.0249", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 26]], "date-time": "2020-02-26T16:08:35Z", "timestamp": 1582733315000}, "page": "134-153", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Historical and Imagined GIS Borderlandscapes of the American West: Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove Tetralogy and LA Noirscapes"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "14", "author": [{"given": "Charles", "family": "Travis", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 26]], "date-time": "2020-02-26T16:08:37Z", "timestamp": 1582733317000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2020.0249"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2020.0249", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 26]], "date-time": "2020-02-26T16:40:27Z", "timestamp": 1582735227695}, "reference-count": 41, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Researchers from the spatial humanities can play an active role in the ongoing discussion around representation and uncertainty in geosocial data. Opportunistic geosocial data from crowdsourced and user contributions are typically available in large quantities, however, these data are generally not sampled or collected with intentionality for research purposes. Therefore, digital traces from geolocationally-enabled devices may not provide data that are directly relevant to addressing precise questions or being used in applications of societal interest. It is crucial to first understand characteristics of geosocial data prior to proceeding with interpretation. The spatial humanities could encourage realization of the role data analysts and researchers play in creating narrative in light of large opportunistic data with many facets of uncertainty. An approach is proposed that suggests directions of inquiry into data limitations based on the characteristics of the source and the properties of the data. Finally, this article notes that the digital world influences the activities of individuals in real-life so the generalizability of the behaviour of users may be limited. Integrating other forms of relevant spatial data can help to bound uncertainty and constrain the interpretation of geosocial data. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2020.0253", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2020, 2, 26]], "date-time": "2020-02-26T16:08:35Z", "timestamp": 1582733315000}, "page": "218-234", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Representation in Geosocial Data: Grappling with Uncertainty in Digital Traces of Human Activity"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "14", "author": [{"given": "Carolynne", "family": "Hultquist", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "reference": [{"key": "b1", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2014.0116", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b2", "DOI": "10.1016/j.habitatint.2014.09.009", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b3", "DOI": "10.3366/cor.2016.0093", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "b4", "author": "Bodenhamer J.

We tackle this information access problem from a geographic information science perspective using a case study exploring a semi-structured historical encyclopedia. We propose a three-pronged approach for this, based around (1) automatic retrieval of spatio-temporal and thematic information from digital text documents; (2) transformation of the extracted information to spatialize and visualize spatio-temporal and thematic structures; and (3) integration of the spatialized displays in an interactive web interface driven by a user-centered design and evaluation approach. We implemented an interactive spatialized network display to allow identification of spatio-temporal relationships hidden in the text archive, complemented by an interactive self-organizing map display to visualize thematic relationships in these text documents. We evaluated the utility and usability of the developed interface in a user study with digital humanities scholars. Empirical results show that the developed interface supports target users in the humanities uncovering latent spatio-temporal and thematic relationships and generated new insights through the spatialized text collection. Adopting this approach, we illustrate one avenue to addressing the information access problem in the digital humanities from a GIScience perspective. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2020.0247",

Recent years have seen new interest in digital gazetteers as bridges between the geospatial web and the semantic web, but many existing digital gazetteers and data models do not meet the needs of historians, as they focus on physiographic landforms rather than places of cultural meaning or administrative units. Historical researchers need to know about places whose locations are not knowable with certainty. They need to know about alternative names for places, about how names have evolved over time, and the specific historical contexts in which names were used. While GIS researchers propose temporal gazetteers, which will somehow include the precise dates at which features were created and removed, we propose historical gazetteers in which dates appear mainly in order to help reference particular instances of place names.

Although various (semi-) automatic linking methods have been proposed, state-of-the-art methods have only been targeted at linking records that correspond to individuals. In this paper, we introduce an automatic method aimed at linking both individuals and households across several historical census datasets. The proposed method contains several steps, including data quality analysis and enhancement, household identity detection, as well as individual and household record linking. We have applied this method to a set of six census datasets collected from the district of Rawtenstall in North-East Lancashire in the United Kingdom between 1851 and 1901. Experimental results show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the ambiguity arising from the individual record linkage, and facilitate the accurate matching of households across several decades. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2014.0130", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10, 7]], "date-time": "2014-10-07T15:37:00Z", "timestamp": 1412696220000}, "page": "204-225", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 14, "title": ["Automatic Record Linkage of Individuals and Households in Historical Census Data"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "8", "author": [{"given": "Zhichun", "family": "Fu", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "H.M.", "family": "Boot", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Peter", "family": "Christen", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Jun", "family": "Zhou", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T16:59:58Z", "timestamp": 1566493198000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2014, 10]]}, "issue": "2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2014.0130"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2014.0130", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3, 12]], "date-time": "2020-03-12T19:03:25Z", "timestamp": 1584039805079}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1-2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> The need for a firm understanding of the working practices of researchers in the humanities emerges as a prerequisite for the development of effective digital research infrastructures. This paper will focus on the rationale behind the design and implementation of two related studies conducted in the context of two European e-Infrastructures projects, DARIAH and EHRI. Within DARIAH the challenge involved conducting, analysing and understanding research practices of arts and humanities researchers, a largely ill-defined community encompassing a wide spectrum of disciplines. Each of them deals with a variety of objects employing an extensive number of methods. In the context of EHRI, the challenge is slightly different, due to the involvement of a better-defined research community. Holocaust researchers share well-identified objects, common ground on methods, and handle similar setbacks. In this paper we discuss the approach adopted for designing and implementing qualitative user-centric studies aimed at capturing activities, methods, and types of information objects employed by researchers grounded in identified research goals and questions. It addresses both generic and specific entities and processes, and supports the understanding of researchers\u2019 working practices in settings as diverse and wide as DARIAH, or as specialized as EHRI. The outcomes of the analysis of working practices are used in determining user requirements for digital infrastructures to serve the respective research communities. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2013.0084", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 11, 1]], "date-time": "2013-11-01T10:35:09Z", "timestamp": 1383302109000}, "page": "105-127", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 11, "title": ["An Approach to Analyzing Working Practices of Research Communities in the Humanities"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "7", "author": [{"given": "Agiatis", "family": "Benardou", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Panos", "family": "Constantopoulos", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Costis", "family": "Dallas", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T15:44:03Z", "timestamp": 1566488643000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2013, 10]]}, "issue": "1-2"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2013.0084"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2013.0084", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2020, 3, 12]], "date-time": "2020-03-12T19:03:25Z", "timestamp": 1584039805096}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["IJHAC"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2016, 3]]}, "abstract": "<jats:p> Contemporary and future historians need to grapple with and confront the challenges posed by web archives. These large collections of material, accessed either through the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine or through other computational methods, represent both a challenge and an opportunity to historians. Through these collections, we have the potential to access the voices of millions of non-elite individuals (recognizing of course the cleavages in both Web access as well as method of access). To put this in perspective, the Old Bailey Online currently describes its monumental holdings of 197,745 trials between 1674 and 1913 as the \u201clargest body of texts detailing the lives of non-elite people ever published.\u201d GeoCities.com, a platform for everyday web publishing in the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s, amounted to over thirty-eight million individual webpages. Historians will have access, in some form, to millions of pages: written by everyday people of various classes, genders, ethnicities, and ages. While the Web was not a perfect democracy by any means \u2013 it was and is unevenly accessed across each of those categories \u2013 this still represents a massive collection of non-elite speech. </jats:p><jats:p> Yet a figure like thirty-eight million webpages is both a blessing and a curse. We cannot read every website, and must instead rely upon discovery tools to find the information that we need. Yet these tools largely do not exist for web archives, or are in a very early state of development: what will they look like? What information do historians want to access? We cannot simply map over web tools optimized for discovering current information through online searches or metadata analysis. We need to find information that mattered at the time, to diverse and very large communities. Furthermore, web pages cannot be viewed in isolation, outside of the networks that they inhabited. In theory, amongst corpuses of millions of pages, researchers can find whatever they want to confirm. The trick is situating it into a larger social and cultural context: is it representative? Unique? </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, \u201cLost in the Infinite Archive,\u201d I explore what the future of digital methods for historians will be when they need to explore web archives. Historical research of periods beginning in the mid-1990s will need to use web archives, and right now we are not ready. This article draws on first-hand research with the Internet Archive and Archive-It web archiving teams. It draws upon three exhaustive datasets: the large Web ARChive (WARC) files that make up Wide Web Scrapes of the Web; the metadata-intensive WAT files that provide networked contextual information; and the lifted-straight-from-the-web guerilla archives generated by groups like Archive Team. Through these case studies, we can see \u2013 hands-on \u2013 what richness and potentials lie in these new cultural records, and what approaches we may need to adopt. It helps underscore the need to have humanists involved at this early, crucial stage. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3366/ijhac.2016.0161", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 3, 9]], "date-time": "2016-03-09T09:09:23Z", "timestamp": 1457514563000}, "page": "78-94", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 15, "title": ["Lost in the Infinite Archive: The Promise and Pitfalls of Web Archives"], "prefix": "10.3366", "volume": "10", "author": [{"given": "Ian", "family": "Milligan", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1931", "container-title": ["International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing"], "language": "en", "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 8, 22]], "date-time": "2019-08-22T17:04:35Z", "timestamp": 1566493475000}, "score": 1.0, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 3]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[2016, 3]]}, "issue": "1"}, "alternative-id": ["10.3366/ijhac.2016.0161"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ijhac.2016.0161", "ISSN": ["1753-8548", "1755-1706"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1753-8548", "type": "print"}, {"value": "1755-1706", "type": "electronic"}]}], "items-per-page": 1000, "query": {"start-index": 0, "search-terms": null}}}
